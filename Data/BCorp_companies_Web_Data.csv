The ACHS Master of Business Administration program fosters a holistic, integrative approach to business in support of more sustainable practices for traditional and integrative healthcare practitioners, entrepreneurs, and those in large, multinational, public, private, and nonprofit corporations. The Aromatherapy program offered me the opportunity to obtain a formal education in my favorite subject area while working full-time. I found the curriculum to be informative and appropriately challenging. The faculty was knowledgeable and approachable. Master of Science in Aromatherapy I've been writing professionally for three decades, but in recent years have shifted my focus. I'm asking fewer questions about various business topics and more questions of those taking part in the conversation, especially considering habits, change, stress, resilience and hope. I became a Certified Health and Wellness Coach through Wellcoaches in early 2019, and opened my coaching business, Gates Open Wellness, not long after. My concurrent studies with ACHS—a Certificate in Wellness Consulting—have helped me fill in gaps of knowledge in terms of stress management, sports nutrition, holistic pathophysiology, business practices and integrative health. Over the past three years during my studies at ACHS, I was able to bring my passion for holistic health to life. I have learned valuable information that will allow me to begin my goal of becoming a holistic lifestyle coach by teaching others to integrate nutrition, herbs, and mindfulness into their lifestyles. Diploma in Holistic Health Practice As a social worker, I am incorporating wellness activities with my staff and the youth we serve. My goals include using aromatherapy as a coping strategy for people experiencing burnout.

Customer service and shipping are topnotch, and Paul is super responsive to emails. This is the best honey I have ever tasted. It is so dark and rich; it reminds me of treacle or molasses. This honey is unlike any I've tried. I collect honey, therefore have a wide palate when it comes to taste. It is a dark, full bodied honey. It is exactly as described. Sweet, caramel/molasses like in texture. It is thick and rich. In the description, it says ""smoky"", don't let that stop you. It does not taste like the smokiness you'd find in meat. Once you try some, you'll be ordering this unique honey over and over again. Oh.. and did I mention... customer service is prompt, friendly, and willing to help in any way. In closing, you just can't go wrong with African Bronze Honey Products. — Andrea A. My family loves raw and unfiltered wild honey however this is absolutely the most unique honey we've ever tried.

Twenty years ago, Zambian Canadian eco-entrepreneur, Dan Ball went into a remote part of Africa to help a few dozen struggling beekeepers sell their honey. He said, ""I can help you, let's start a business."" Today, Dan has trained over 6000 beekeepers. But Dan had a problem; with a growing list people waiting to be trained and equipped as beekeepers, he needed to generate more income. So, he turned to long-time friends, Canadian artist-entrepreneurs and former Zimbabwean residents, Paul Whitney and Liz Connell, ""Help me value add our honey,"" he said, ""and bring it to Canada and the U.S. We started the African Bronze Honey Company, ordered a container load of wild and fabulous honey and started telling everyone we knew.

Heady Topper was designed to showcase the complex flavors and aromas these flowers produce. The Alchemist has been brewing Heady Topper since 2003. This Double IPA is not intended to be the strongest or most bitter DIPA. It is brewed to give you wave after wave of hop flavor without any astringent bitterness. We brew Heady Topper with a proprietary blend of six hops – each imparting its own unique flavor and aroma. Take a big sip of Heady and see what hop flavors you can pick out. There is just enough malt to give this beer some backbone, but not enough to take the hops away from the center stage. For eight years, Heady Topper was served on tap exclusively at our seven barrel brewpub in downtown Waterbury. In early 2011 we built the Alchemist Cannery, a 15 barrel brewery and canning line, for the production of our flagship IPA. The first cans of Heady Topper rolled off the line just two days after Tropical Storm Irene demolished The Alchemist Pub and Brewery. Today we brew 180 barrels per week in twelve 15 barrel batches.

Over many years, Animikii has developed ""Giving Back"" programs that aim to fulfil our commitment to drive positive change for Indigenous People. Many of these programs started out quite informally but in working through the process for B Corp certification, Animikii has recognized the benefits of reporting and formalizing these programs. As a result, the Animikii team worked in 2016 to record and formalize our Giving Back processes and we will continue do so into 2017 and the years to come. About this Report 2016 was an important year for Animikii but more importantly, it was a momentous year for Indigenous People in Canada. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC) presented its findings in June of 2015. Thus, 2016 was the first full post-TRC year; the first year that we had as a country to react to the organization's 94 Calls to Action. In some ways, we saw tangible steps taken towards the vision of Reconciliation the vision that we heard Residential School Survivors and Indigenous Community leaders speak so passionately about but in other ways, we fell short. We have now had a full year post-TRC to reflect on our progress as individuals, as Communities and as a country and to make a plan to do better next year. While Animikii has always existed to serve Indigenous Communities in some way, this year our organization particularly pushed itself to ensure that our business operated in service of our organizational goal to foster Reconciliation in Canada through innovation and technology. We wanted to compile and share this report to show the steps that Animikii has taken to drive positive changes for Indigenous Peoples in Canada. Going forward, we will use this report as a guide for our own actions; we will strive each year to do better than the year before. We have divided the body of this report into these four sections to more clearly define each of these four programs, and to record our accountability in each of these areas. We supplement the body of this report with additional information about our partners and about our vision for the future of Animikii's Giving Back programs. This Social Impact Report is our benchmark, our report card, our first public report that shares exactly what actions we took as a company to support our goal of driving positive change for Indigenous People. This is our first Social Impact Report, and we welcome your comments or questions about the information we've provided in the following pages. We are always pushing to do more to bring Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians together in support of a more inclusive and equitable Canada. If you have questions or comments about our report, or if you would like to get in touch with us about an opportunity to work together, please contact us here. The Monetary Giving section reports the actual funds provided by Animikii in the forms of sponsorships, scholarships, bursaries and charitable donations. Animikii provides funding to projects that foster Reconciliation in Canada through innovation and technology. We try to focus on providing monetary support (in the forms of grants, sponsorships, scholarships, etc.) to projects that specifically encourage or enable Indigenous youth to explore technology and entrepreneurship as potential career or educational paths. As an organization, Animikii sees technology and entrepreneurship as societal equalizers. Given the drive and the opportunity, emerging Indigenous technologists can utilize their skills to improve their lives and to lift up their home Communities. We want to encourage Indigenous youth to pursue technology because technology and entrepreneurial careers allow youth the opportunity to work from their home Communities, to employ community members and to effectively scale up economic prosperity for Indigenous Peoples. We want Indigenous youth to feel empowered to shape the landscape of Indigenous economic development, rather than being seen as a ""labour pool"" for others' economic development plans so we support projects that facilitate these opportunities. A majority of Animikii's monetary giving in 2016 was focused on Charitable Giving and Sponsorships. We decided to provide support to these particular partners on a case-by-case as we were approached. We evaluated each team and project that approached us to ask for support and provided funding for as many reputable projects as we could. Furthermore, we strengthened our existing relationships with our long-term partners by providing financial support for their projects when we could and when a monetary donation was deemed to be the best path to supporting the project. In 2017, we hope to be more intentional with our giving by launching an Animikii grant application process that will allow us to evaluate and accept a greater number of projects at one time rather than supporting projects on a case-by-case basis. We feel that by creating a more formal application process, we will be able to support more projects and increase the impact of our Monetary Giving. In 2016, Animikii engaged in both direct giving and giving through partner organizations. Animikii's Monetary Giving directly benefitted 11 Indigenous students through our scholarship and bursary programs. In the summer of 2016, Animikii provided $1,000 in scholarships for Indigenous youth to participate in an Indigenous-focused entrepreneurship and technology summer camp run by the organization Startup Skool. The scholarships allowed 8 students to attend the educational summer camp. Scholarship recipients were chosen based on financial need and responses to application questions. Without Animikii's support, most of the Indigenous students who eventually participated would not have been able to afford to attend the Startup Skool camp. The summer camp was for ages 8-12 and took place on the traditional territory of the WS'ANEC' (Saanich), Lekwungen (Songhees), and Wyomilth (Esquimalt) people of the Coast Salish Nation on the University of Victoria campus. Beyond providing scholarships for attendees to the Indigenous-focused Startup Skool summer camp, Animikii employees also provided value to the camp by volunteering to lead a coding workshop with the students. Within the workshop, Animikii Thunderbirds led the students through basic coding concepts and they guided students through an Hour of Code exercise. Animikii's CEO, Jeff Ward, also participated on the ""Dragon's"" panel on the students' pitch day. In the fall of 2016, Animikii started a new project called, FrancOcean Pacific. This educational project was championed by Pacific Peoples' Partnership and Fish Eye Project. The purpose of FrancOcean Pacifique was to provide a unique learning opportunity for Francophone youth living in British Columbia and youth living in New Caledonia in the South Pacific. FrancOcean Pacifique was an ocean study program that brought together cohorts of students who live oceans away; its focus was on cultural and knowledge exchange between Canadian and New Caledonian youth through the lens of the shared Pacific ocean. Animikii sponsored this project by creating its website; the site was designed to be reflective of Indigenous culture and respectful of the goals of the project. Our goal with the design of the site was to highlight the relationship and the commonalities between Indigenous Peoples of the North Pacific and the Indigenous Peoples of the South Pacific. We wanted to include art of both Northern and Southern Pacific Indigenous artists and we wanted to visually represent the connection through the ocean. Animikii is proud to support this project because it allowed for cultural exchange and sharing of traditional Indigenous knowledge with interested youth from across the ocean. We love to see Indigenous perspectives and teachings brought formally into Canadian classrooms. Pictured Above: Animikii CEO, Jeff Ward, with Pacific Peoples' Partnership (PPP) Executive Director, April Ingham. Animikii provided support to PPP in development of its 2016 program, FrancOcean Pacifique. You can read about FrancOcean Pacifique, and about Animikii's involvement in the program here. The Time-Based Giving section of this report shows all of the work and volunteering hours that Animikii donated to projects in 2016. While Animikii's Monetary Giving Back program is, generally, more focused on programs that support Indigenous youth exploring technology and entrepreneurship, our Time-Based Giving Back program is slightly more flexible. Much like our paid work, Animikii takes on volunteer projects across a variety of industries and sectors. We chose projects to support based on the goals, values and expected impacts of each program. Animikii worked with several existing partners within our Time-Based Giving Back efforts; strengthening existing relationships with our long-term partners by providing volunteer hours and pro-bono time for their projects. For example, we worked with the First Nations Technology Council voluntarily on projects like the Bridging to Technology Program and on internal FNTC projects. We have a close relationship with FNTC and will continue to develop this relationship further. FNTC is a truly innovative team that consistently invites us into interesting projects that allow us to reach our organizational goals for equitable outcomes. Animikii provided pro-bono and volunteer hours to partner organizations and charitable projects throughout 2016; without our resources and support, some of the projects that we supported wouldn't have been possible. Animikii is grateful to be partners in the projects detailed below; we're always happy to volunteer our time to meaningful projects that align with our goals and values. Overall, Animikii donated over $30,000 of in-kind value through just our Time-Based Giving Back program in 2016. We supported a broad cross-section of organizations that included projects in the areas of Indigenous education, youth, digital skills literacy, entrepreneurship, law, affordable housing and employment. Our projects reached thousands of Canadians both Indigenous and non-Indigenous. As changemakers we believe that each of these projects positively impacted Canadians' understanding of Reconciliation and the state of Indigenous-settler relations in this country. In March of 2016, Animikii's close partner organization, First Nations Technology Council, announced its new province-wide initiative to increase Indigenous participation in the technology sector, called Bridging to Technology. This innovative program combines classroom learning with experiential learning opportunities for Indigenous students; it provides students with mentorship opportunities and support during and after completion of the course. This program allows students to explore a variety of technology-focused career opportunities. Animikii has been a proud partner of this program since its inception and we continue to support Bridging to Technology. It's important for us as an Indigenous technology company to ensure that Indigenous youth continue to engage with technology in positive ways; it's about supporting their goals and opening up opportunities for youth in our Communities but in the long term vision for Animikii, it's about growing the talent-base of Indigenous designers and developers who might one day choose to collaborate with us or our partners on social, economic and cultural initiatives. On October 3rd, 2016, the first Bridging to Technology cohort began its first classes in the program. That same day, Animikii notified both students in this first cohort that they had received a $250 bursary from Animikii to be used for any books, supplies or cost of living expenses during the Bridging program. Lydia Prince: Lydia identifies as Dak'elh/Cree; her family is from Binche Keyoh and she grew up in Fort St. Lydia has a background in graphic design; she graduated with her Bachelor's of Design degree from the Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary and has worked as a freelance graphic designer. Through the Bridging to Technology program, Lydia hopes to gain the coding and web development skills she needs to remain competitive as a graphic designer, and to explore the opportunities available in the programming space. In her future career, Lydia hopes to use her skills to help youth inremote, Indigenous Communities to harness technology as a way of feeling more connected to communities across Canada and around the world. Gabe Archie: Gabe is Tsq'escenemc from Canim Lake, BC. He has always been interested in computers and looks forward to building up his network of Indigenous technologists in the Bridging program. He's excited to meet his new cohort-mates, instructors and mentors from the technology industry. Gabe has a background in filmmaking and has two certificates in filmmaking, one from New York Digital Film Academy and another from Capilano University. In his future career he hopes to explore programming and potentially work on app development especially for projects like Indigenous language revitalization applications. Pathways to Reconciliation Conference: This conference principally organized by the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation was hosted on June 15-18, 2016 at the University of Winnipeg. Animikii was a conference co-sponsor and provided over 50 hours of pro-bono time to the conference's website. The Pathways to Reconciliation Conference occurred around the one year anniversary of the publication of the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada; a goal was to bring Canadians of all backgrounds together to reflect on the first year of the new ""Reconciliation"" era. Over 400 people attended the conference including Indigenous leaders, allies, and Canadians from all backgrounds and professional sectors. The conference was designed to get attendants to think critically about the steps being taken towards Reconciliation and to think about the next necessary steps in Reconciliation. You can find more information about the Pathways to Reconciliation Conference and watch conference recordings here. The Supporting Reconciliation section of this report records the activities Animikii Thunderbirds undertook to directly support Reconciliation in Canada. How to share with just friends. Animikii's founder started the National Aboriginal Day activism campaign with an idea to write a blog piece asking why Canada has not designated National Aboriginal Day as a national, statutory holiday. He and a few Animikii team members would eventually publish a piece, ""Why Isn't National Aboriginal Day A Formal Statutory Holiday?"" on the Animikii blog. Animikii produced a video version to complement the original written piece, of the same title, and shared it through social media. The article and video quickly gained traction online within and outside of Animikii's networks. Animikii shared the piece with The Globe and Mail, where it received even broader distribution and readership. Jeff was contacted by news outlets like CBC and Maclean's for comment or permission to use the piece. After the success of the National Aboriginal Day blog and video, Animikii started getting requests to turn the idea into a national petition. While we welcomed the feedback and considered the idea of the project, for several months, we left the idea where it was. However, in September of 2016, Jeff was able to connect with MP Robert-Falcon Ouellette to discuss plans for a proper House of Commons petition. Jeff and the team researched the process of a Canadian federal petition (see below), and decided to take it on. We have included these activities under our ""Supporting Reconciliation"" section because we believe that the creation of a federal statutory holiday commemorating the contributions of Indigenous Canadians to the national identity will help to bring Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians together. For more information about this National petition and the activities that led to it, please read our blog piece on the petition here; you can also read and add your name to the Federal petition here. In order for a Federal petition to be brought to the Canadian House of Commons, there is a process in place that begins with a single Canadian resident or citizen drafting and submitting a petition to https://petitions.parl.gc.ca. At this point, the petition must be supported by 5 additional Canadian residents or citizens. All of Animikii's team members acted as the first 6 petition supporters. The petition then must be sponsored by an active Member of Parliament in this case, MP Robert-Falcon Ouellette and then approved by the federal Clerk of Petitions. At this point, the petition goes live and has 120 days to garner 500 signatures in support. Animikii devoted considerable resources to creating and promoting this petition within and outside of our networks because we believe that it will bring up an important discussion in the House of Commons about talking about supporting Indigenous Canadians vs. taking action to support Indigenous Peoples. We hope that our petition prompts Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians to think about Indigenous Peoples' place in Canadian society today. Animikii's major partner with this project is Robert-Falcon Ouellette, MP in the riding of Winnipeg Centre in the House of Commons of Canada. We discussed with Robert-Falcon Ouellette after receiving national media attention for the team's National Aboriginal Day activism. Our team was familiar with MP Ouellette as a politician after looking further into his record of public service, we felt he was the right person to support the e-petition. We feel that he is doing important work as an MP and were happy to have his support on this activism project. As of January 1st, 2017 the petition first launched by Animikii CEO, Jeff Ward and then supported by Animikii's 5 other team members had garnered 715 signatures. This included signatories living in each of Canada's 10 provinces and 3 territories, as well as several Canadian citizens living abroad. The petition easily surpassed the 500 signature requirement to ensure that the petition will be discussed in Canada's House of Commons. The online petition will close in February, 2017 we look forward to following its progress through Federal politics in 2017. You can find the petition itself here. Animikii's video reached 211,561 Facebook users and had 74,858 video views. Our petition was signed by over 700 Canadians and Canadian residents and more will hear our perspective when the petition is discussed in the Canadian House of Commons. We believe these tangible, verifiable signals are only the beginning of the positive impacts that our efforts will inspire. As this petition circulates national politics, we believe it will contribute meaningfully to the ongoing national conversation about Reconciliation particularly in the context of celebrating Indigenous Canadians' ongoing contributions to the Nation. We further believe that beyond the conversation, our petition will inspire more Canadians to take concrete actions to drive positive changes for Indigenous Canadians, and ultimately positive changes for Canada. Specifically, our activism on this issue has always included calls to individuals Canadians particularly entrepreneurs and business owners to not wait for the gears of Federal politics to grind on this issue but to choose to take National Aboriginal Day (June 21) off each year and to provide that day off for employees to allow them to engage in the cultural and celebratory events that occur around the country every year on this day. We created this infographic to promote the petition and provide an educational piece that shows the history of Aboriginal Day in a visual way. The Community Development section of this report details the actions that the Animikii team undertook through our work to try to support the Indigenous technology and entrepreneurial communities in Canada. The concept behind our Community Development program is to undertake activities that we believe will encourage innovation in Indigenous communities across Canada. We work towards this goal through two main methods: the cultivation of our online presence and participation in Indigenous events particularly in the realms of innovation, technology and entrepreneurship. In 2016 Animikii gained the capacity to expand its online presence from primarily sharing news and event information to cultivating a strong online voice amplifying Indigenous issues to an Indigenous and non-Indigenous audience. Through our social channels (primarily Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) Animikii has worked to share stories that are of importance to an Indigenous audience. In particular, we have worked to share stories of language and cultural resilience and Indigenous innovation whenever possible. In service of this goal, Animikii developed its new original content series called Indigenous Innovators. In 2016, this series was built around two primary content types: original blog pieces and original social media based on quotes by Indigenous leaders. We decided to share these original pieces through our social media because we recognized that while we had built up a large following, we could be doing more to directly contribute positive stories about Indigenous innovators so we started writing. The Indigenous Innovators series had two long-form blog posts and 11 ""quote posts"" featuring quotes from First Nation, Métis and Inuit leaders. The two leaders that we featured in long-form blog posts were Nadya Kwandibens of Red Works Photography and Justin Louis of Section 35 apparel. We strive to increase the frequency of our long-form blog posts in 2017. Beyond our Indigenous Innovators series, we are also trying to increase the innovation to come from our local Community of Indigenous entrepreneurs through the development of an Indigenous Innovation Centre to be based on Songhees Nation. Animikii developed on the idea for this Innovation Centre over several months with leaders from Songhees Nation. The Innovation Centre will be a hub-like, communal co-work space that actively fosters, organizational partnership-building and rich idea exchanges. The centre will be a work space that offers small businesses, entrepreneurs, non-profits and other organizations services like: hot desks, co-working space, fixed office space, meeting rooms, and office infrastructure. We will host and encourage others to host workshops, discussions, forums and Celebrations within the space to build the sense of Community built on Indigenous entrepreneurship and innovation. Animikii contributed to the community of Indigenous innovators by attending and participating in Indigenous entrepreneurship-focused events like the Indigenous Innovation Summit, organized by the National Association of Friendship Centres and several Aboriginal Business Match conferences. Supporting and participating in these events is crucial for them to continue and to thrive; the Indigenous entrepreneurship community is growing every year, due in some part because of the formal and informal mentorships and networking in the industry. We believe that as a leader in this space, it is part of our responsibility to support Indigenous businesses and organizations that want to explore this certification. We attended B Corp events and we are active in B Corp spaces in order to promote Indigenous social innovation and to act as a mentor organization for any Indigenous businesses that may want support in exploring this certification. For the Indigenous Innovators series, we basically requested interviews with innovative entrepreneurs and leaders from within our own network. We hope that as the series grows and becomes more established, we will be able to work with Indigenous leaders both within and outside of our networks. We approached Songhees Nation to work with us on the Indigenous Innovation Centre because we believed our two organizations would be best positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. We believe that the Victoria area is an opportune location for this project because the tech community is small but growing along with the Indigenous entrepreneurial community. Further, we know that there are National and regional Indigenous organizations within this community who need places to work in Victoria on occasion, as they often have cause to work in BC's capital, but for the time being, it makes more sense for them to remain headquartered in Vancouver. We also believe this is an advantageous partnership because in our experience, Songhees Nation is a very forward-thinking Nation, looking to make real investments in innovation, and entrepreneurship for economic development purposes. There are many Indigenous entrepreneurs who rely on role models and mentors to get started; we try to do everything we can to develop the Community of Indigenous innovators and entrepreneurs because we know it will grow the Indigenous economy overall. We believe that it is the networking and mentorship activity that allows new Indigenous entrepreneurs to enter and thrive in this industry. Animikii continues to attend and support events like the Indigenous Innovation Summit, Aboriginal Business Match conferences and even Cando's National Conference and Annual General Meeting (see Time-Based Giving Back) because it allows us to connect with entrepreneurs emerging and established and find ways to work together. We choose to use our online platforms to amplify the voices of Indigenous leaders because we know it will positively impact emerging Indigenous innovators looking for role models, mentors and even inspiration. We also believe that by sharing these stories of resilience, success and overcoming obstacles, we can challenge the negative stereotypes of Indigenous Peoples that many Canadians may hold as truth. Spotlight ""Justin Louis never set out to be a political activist; although his work is often read as political, for him it's ""just about giving a voice to people, using something as simple as a t-shirt to spread or share a message."" Justin is the co-founder of SECTION 35, the streetwear brand based on Coast Salish Territory in Vancouver, BC. The partners section of this report provides an overview of Animikii's many stakeholders. This section encompasses suppliers, clients, organizations we have volunteered for or with, organizations we have contributed funds to or with and the like. We name each of these types of stakeholders as ""partners"" because Animikii is always working to build long-term relationships with each of our stakeholders. In 2016, Animikii partnered with organizations and individuals from across industry and sector lines; we are always looking for ways to bring in pertinent partners and to collaborate with other organizations that operate within the Indigenous space. We are proud that (overall) Animikii has worked with approximately 95% Indigenous-focused organizations. Each year Animikii works to build long-term relationships with all of its stakeholders including employees, contractors, customers and other partners. The end of an Animikii project is almost never the end of a working relationship we always do our best to reach out to past customers and previous contractors when the opportunity is right. This section of the Social Impact Report is all about the future of Animikii's Giving Back Programs. Within this section we detail our goals for the growth of the projects listed throughout this report, as well as any projects we plan to launch going forward. Goals 2016 was a year of progress for Animikii; for 2017 we hope to build on this progress, not to coast off a good year. Animikii intends to grow its social impact compiling and sharing this report is the first step in growing that impact. We believe that in order to grow our Giving Back programs effectively, we need to be more systematic in our approaches. We want to make sure that each dollar and each hour that we provide to partners and causes in 2017 is doing as much good for Indigenous People as possible. This is not to say that we want to put a fully structured, bureaucratic system in place that removes any subjectivity from our decision-making; we want Animikii Thunderbirds (team members) to be passionate about the projects that we take on, thus we are committed to continuing to support our existing partners and taking on projects that are of particular interest to our team, but we also want to create more robust evaluation systems to ensure that the projects we take on will be effective. Specifically, Animikii is considering putting in place a more formalized grant application something similar to the existing Animikii Tech/Entrepreneurship Bursary program. We want to keep the barriers to applying for the grant to be low we know that great programs don't necessarily have the resources to devote a lot of time to seeking out and applying for grants but we want to ensure that we are making as informed decisions as possible with our available Monetary Giving Back budget. In 2016, Animikii gave out its first Animikii Tech Bursary for Indigenous youth to Lí'lwat7ul TRU student, Melvin James (see below). Melvin is the first of many emerging, Indigenous technologists to receive an Animikii Bursary in 2016, we hope to provide 1-2 more bursaries in the areas of technology and entrepreneurship. We accept bursary application on an ongoing basis; you can find more information about the program and the application form itself on our website here. In 2017, Animikii's goals for our Time-Based Giving Back program is to increase the number of volunteer hours donated, and to approximately maintain the number of pro-bono hours donated. We would like to take on more volunteer projects as a team and are actively seeking meaningful, relevant volunteer opportunities for our organization. Our ongoing efforts to support meaningful Reconciliation in Canada or meaningful opportunities for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians to work together to create positive change for Indigenous Peoples and to create a more informed and inclusive Canada will continue into 2017. Our activist efforts to have National Aboriginal Day (or National Indigenous Day) designated as a statutory holiday will continue throughout this year. Further, Animikii will continue to provide National Aboriginal Day off as a holiday for all employees and contractors and we will encourage other small businesses in Canada to do the same. The Animikii team will continue to look for chances for our organization to make a meaningful difference to the thoughts and actions of Canadians both Indigenous and non-Indigenous towards the idea of Reconciliation. We believe that in order to prosper in our Communities, Canadians must work together to understand each other's' perspectives, and also must recognize and take positive action to respond to the ugly history and ongoing racism in Canada towards Indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups. Wherever our organization can be an instrument of change towards Reconciliation, we will take the opportunity to do so. Animikii sees Community Development as participating in Indigenous technology and education-related events and programs, and amplifying the voices of Indigenous innovators through our networks. We will continue many of our actions from 2016 into 2017 with these programs, and we will also take on new projects within this space. Animikii is in the process of expanding the Indigenous Innovators series for 2017 we strive to create original content through this series more regularly, and we strive to share the voices and stories of truly innovative individuals who might be less known to a broad Indigenous audience. We are also planning to expand the presentation of our series to include a podcasting element to amplify these voices. We believe that this series will allow innovators within the Indigenous Community to be seen by a larger audience and potentially grow their own programs or businesses as a result. As for participation in Indigenous events, Animikii is currently in the process of planning a new Indigenous Innovation Centre (co-working space) on Lekwungen (Songhees) territory in Victoria, BC. We have been working towards this goal for several months already and in 2017 we believe the Centre will be operational. This centre will become one of the main focuses of our Community Development Giving Back program; we will be able to facilitate and participate in Indigenous innovation events on a regular basis. We look forward to contributing to the many innovative projects and collaborative ideas to come from this Centre. Animikii is a certified B Corp one of the first Indigenous-owned B Corps in Canada. We want to take on leadership role in the Indigenous B Corp community and find ways to support Indigenous-owned organizations that want to explore B Corp certification. As part of B Corp's first ""Inclusion Challenge"" Animikii has set internal to improve our own diversity and inclusion metrics. We look forward to taking on this challenge and reporting on our results in next year's social impact report. In 2017 and beyond we strive to find new ways to work with Indigenous-owned social ventures that want to learn more about B Corp certification. Melvin James Animikii 2016 Tech Bursary Winner: Melvin James, 28, is an Indigenous technologist from Lil'wat First Nation, Mount Currie in the interior of BC. Melvin is specifically interested in programming and software development, but he's purposefully keeping an open mind about his career path and seeking out broad technology experience through co-ops. For example, Melvin worked at TRU in IT services while he took classes in 2016. Melvin values his education for the many doors it opens in career, but he also values the opportunity to meet new people and learning new things every day. He has made valuable connections with Indigenous students on campus especially through the TRU Powwow Club that Melvin started and the TRU Drum Club that meets regularly at Cplul'kw'ten (""the Gathering Place"") on campus. However, Melvin also values the opportunities he's had to meet and work with students from all cultures in his classes, work terms and other school clubs on campus.

Do what the rest of the world has already done: use technology to improve efficiencies. APDS Solution: Replace physical mail with email and eliminate cost centers such as libraries through the use of eBooks, lowering costs for prisons and prison families. Research proves that education, job training and rehabilitation just plain work. APDS Solution: Employ proven distance learning solutions to deliver a full range of programs to inmates to drive better behavior behind bars and lower rates of recidivism. Institutionally funded devices expand the breadth and depth of programming available to inmates with digital libraries, secure communications and online courseware.

Only open platform that supports multiple vendors to deliver inmate services in a fair and equitable way, ensuring all resources remain cost free to users. APDS began deployment in September 2014 at Madison Juvenile Correctional Facility to provide tablets to all juvenile girls at their maximum security facility. After a highly successful initial deployment in providing safe and effective educational and rehabilitative programming, as well as behavior reward tools, the state extended the program. APDS tablets offer a full range of academic and rehabilitative resources specifically targeted to this at-risk population. Successes include calmer facility, less violence, academic gains in reading and earlier intervention in mental health cases. APDS coaching and content led to a remarkably high jump in literacy levels amongst female learners. Reading scores (as measured by pre and post-WRAT testing) for young women in the facility improved (on average) by more than 4 grade levels throughout 2+ years of the APDS program. Susan Lockwood, Director of Juvenile Education, Indiana Department of Corrections Five Keys Charter Schools and Programs Since October 2014, APDS began a partnership with 5 Keys Charter Schools to bring secure tablets to several Bay-Area correctional facilities. The program is focused on education, rehabilitation, reentry services, and has garnered considerable and favorable media attention. The program centers around the Five Keys adult high school curriculum along with an array of additional resources including an online literacy program, job training, mental health literature, a substance abuse program, an online legal library, reentry materials and a number of APDS resources including TED Talks, National Corrections Library, Secure Content Locker and the Learning Management System. Facility staff, teachers and inmates view the tablets, APDS support and training, as indispensable educational and rehabilitation tools. The NYC DOC program for young adults began in February 2016 at the Robert N Davoren Center (RNDC) and the Rose M Singer Center (RMSC). Tablets were deployed during the pilot program. Initial response from staff, inmates and COs has been overwhelmingly positive. APDS began a partnership with the NYC DOE in June 2015 to bring its technology to the work District 79 does with juveniles on Rikers Island. The program began with extensive teacher training on utilizing APDS tablets to deliver educational programming. The program rapidly expanded to put technology into the hands of juveniles on Rikers Island to support individualized instruction and ongoing education at the East River Academy.

Technology has solved a number of important social issues that affect humanity. Education has become democratized and health information can be distributed to doctors around the world via the internet. Vaccines are delivered via drones. The world is changing because of technology. A juvenile correctional facility in southeastern Indiana started an experiment two years ago. It distributed secure tablet computers to all of the girls. The goal of the technology was to help improve the girls' educational experiences and opportunities. But the tablets are having an impact beyond the classroom. The U.S. prison system is absolutely massive—more than two million Americans are currently in jail, and 40 percent of inmates return to prison within three years. This also takes an economic toll—$74 billion in U.S. taxpayer money is used annually to offset correction costs for America's 2.2 million prisoners (who represent 22 percent of the entire world prison population). For most of the developed world, internet access is a given. Google, Amazon, Facebook offer a privileged world of communication, entertainment, shopping and education that many of us take for granted. Unless, that is, you happen to be incarcerated. Tablet-based systems in correctional facilities help inmates get educated, learn new skills—and maybe find a job when they're released. The data is still being collected, but the staff at the Madison Juvenile Correctional Facility is noticing the nearly 50 incarcerated young women are calmer, not filing as many grievances and reading more books. The concept is simple: Seed inmates with feature-limited Galaxy Tab S2s. The inmates typically have access to only educational and vocational apps, through in some cases they can use the tablets to read ebooks, and prepare for upcoming court cases... A growing number of facilities are adopting more immediate means of communication such as email from handheld devices, providing a way for inmates to stay in touch more regularly with family members. One in every four kids in the United States fails to complete high school on time. Some San Francisco jail inmates are now in possession of computer tablets they can use to do homework, read novels and prepare for their criminal cases. The tablets were distributed Wednesday to more than 100 inmates. Cutting edge technology isn't normally available to the more than 2 million men and women jailed in the United States — cost, security concerns and a criminal justice system that has favored punishment over rehabilitation are among the reasons. APDS aims to help people behind bars get an education by supplying them with a platform for receiving appropriate curriculum. The idea is to supplement whatever curriculum is provided officially by giving prisoners tablets.. For more information, please send us a message. We will get back to you shortly.

Arctic Solar Ventures was professional and helpful throughout the project. We did a 48 panel solar array on our commercial building and it appears to be producing better then expectations. I hired ASV to install solar panels on my home in South Anchorage. I signed their proposal on May 11th and 20 days later at 3:30 pm my system was turned on. I figured the time was ripe to harness the sunshine here in the mat-su valley. i chose a vertical array on the 3 story wall on the southwest side of the house for ease of maintenance and fear of wind, snow and foot traffic on my roof; knowing that there would be a trade off in efficiency. The installation of the panels went very well. 17 300 watt panels. looks good, very sturdy infrastructure. The installation of the battery, inverter and switching was very professional. i have great confidence in the workmanship and equipment.

To lawyers, they operate as a broker: They send them pre-vetted clients, and earn a percentage of what they make from each successful representation.

Who are their clients? A sample to date: A woman harassed for refusing her boss’s advances. A child whose parent died without a will. A father disabled after being hit by a truck. An immigrant seeking to grow her family. Some of these folks are rural and low-income; others are wealthy and well-educated.

We'll advise you on the content types, outlets and cadences most likely to attract and retain your ideal community. We've managed editorial calendars for long-form business publications, built social media audiences from zero to over a million—and everything in between. Whether it's a thought piece, an Instagram meme, a sales-support one-sheet or a video, we have the writers, editors and resources to deliver top-notch content. Many businesses are out in the world doing amazing work and even writing about, photographing or recording it. Yet without harnessing the power of search engine optimization, they're missing out on the enormous potential of readers and consumers searching the web. By optimizing your content and your site, we make sure the people who want to read about what you're doing can find you, and that your site becomes a high-quality, up-to-date authority consistently recommended by search engines. Organic search is important, but in today's oversaturated content world, it will only get you so far. Our vision of modern ""earned media"" means finding your tribe—that means other organizations, publications, groups and nonprofits whose mission and outlook aligns with yours — then sharing stories and messages that resonate with your shared audiences, creating an ever-growing community that cares about the things you care about. Whether it's content-sharing on social media, creating cause-based syndication groups among like-minded publications, or aiding your storytellers in finding the outlets best-suited for their voices, we like to think creatively, build alliances, and work cooperatively to share messages about the important work our clients are doing in the world. We know that goals are only worthwhile if they're measurable, and in order for a digital strategy to be great, it has to be trackable. By setting a course with your help, then measuring our successes and failures and adjusting accordingly, we stay on the front-edge of communications strategy and help ensure your communications are delivering the results you want. The most important word in communications today is community. Our clients' customers don't want to align with faceless corporations who make inferior products on the backs of the world's poor and marginalized people. Building community takes more time and effort than, say, putting out a coupon, but it will also create a dedicated, loyal base of customers who will stick with you, champion your products and ideals, and come back to you time and again.

BILD is an innovation consultancy working with forward-thinking leaders to accelerate performance and sustainable growth. We unearth opportunities & insights that elevate performance. Data is not enough. To move a business forward meaningfully, you need real insight on which problems and opportunities hold the promise of exponential impact. We help clients see themselves and their stakeholders in ways that unlock new levels of performance. We define strategies that fuel sustainable, profitable growth. Growth is the byproduct of a business that is designed to deliver value and serve stakeholder needs in extraordinary ways. We work with clients to define deeply integrated strategies that optimize social, environmental, and economic capital to fuel sustainable growth. We design products and business models that create new value. Value-creating innovation is hard. We use lean, human-centered design processes and rapid qualitative prototyping to turn raw ideas into viable concepts that can help clients find new customers, enter new markets, and create new revenue streams. Over the last 30 years, BILD partners have helped some of the world's most recognizable companies find more performance and create more profitable, sustainable growth. If we're going to solve big problems and unlock big opportunities together, how we think and work matters. Here's a little preview of what makes our processes and work product unique: We believe sustainability is profitability. Time, experience, and a lot of data have taught us that integrated value strategies drive more revenue, deeper engagement, stronger growth, and better returns. Everything we do is based on the premise that creating value sustainably is just better business. We help you focus on what matters most. In most companies (and in life), 80% of the value produced comes from 20% of the inputs. The key to accelerating performance and sustainable growth lies in quickly identifying those critically important investments and focusing time and resources there ruthlessly. We're human-centered by design. Lean, human-centered design principles ground all of our work. Because seeing things from the perspective of the people we're designing for is what allows us to build products, brands, and business models that truly win hearts, disrupt markets and redefine the future. The future will be shaped by organizations that dynamically embrace the risks presented by climate change and social inequality as opportunities to profitably do good in a stakeholder-fueled economy. As firms reset in a post-pandemic society, many are taking advantage of the moment to shift toward integrated value creation across their value chains. We all know we need to be more resilient for the future, but implementing sustainable practices requires a departure from thinking only in terms of shareholder value to a more dynamic, integrated value creation strategy. This innovative spirit must propel our firms into the future. Stakeholder capitalism is on the rise. Forward-thinking corporate leaders, investors, and a growing wave of socially and environmentally-conscious consumers everywhere are beginning to move in the direction of this new form of capitalism that levels the playing field between profits, people, and planet. Treating strategy as a verb is becoming more critical for organizations in an increasingly complex global environment. Creating and maintaining a dynamic strategic planning process is key for any company that seeks to deliver sustainable value to its stakeholders. Leadership is about more than just inspiration and vision. It's also about the effective day to day navigation of complex situations, people, and priorities towards a common goal. For mid-market leaders especially, the landscape is uniquely complex. It's amazing what humans can accomplish when they have clearly defined goals, understand what needs to be done, and fully commit the resources to get there. In honor of the 80/20 principle and our obsession with getting to what matters most and doing it, here are our favorite 14 examples of lightning-quick human achievement. Mid-market organizations face unique market challenges and need equally unique consulting partners at the table to help guide them toward outsized returns on their strategy and innovation investments. Businesses create value by leveraging capital for the benefit of stakeholders. When most of us think about the term capital, we gravitate to the most tangible things like equipment and cold hard cash. In the world of Business 2.0, we need to define and recognize four basic forms of capital that can be leveraged to unlock performance and spur growth: economic, social, natural, and strategic. Businesses that move decisively to incorporate material Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues into their core strategy will create a competitive advantage and real, measurable increases in enterprise value. A successful strategy can take many forms, but it must serve to provide clarity for the investment of organizational energy and capital. And in a dynamically changing environment, it needs to be agile, adaptable, and responsive. If it doesn't do that, it's broken. We know from first-hand experience that it's possible to rapidly innovate and pivot for survival today while also building long-term social, environmental and economic resilience. The world's most valuable company is grappling with the realities of its goal to eventually manufacture every new iPhone, Apple Watch, and glitzy yet-to-be-invented gizmo using 100% renewable power, and (this is the big one) without mining any new raw materials from the planet. A huge factor in the prevalence of loneliness at work is the lack of a nurtured and authentic community. As humans, we are organically communal. When the ability to form connections is absent it's natural for us to feel isolated. While organizational change can be difficult, regardless of the circumstances, it can be particularly challenging to create change in organizations that have longstanding histories and deeply embedded cultural norms, beliefs, and assumptions.

Our strict sourcing and business practices are designed to have minimal negative impact on the environment, while the products themselves are of the utmost highest quality. Our hemp is bred specifically for terpene and cannabinoid contents. We've partnered with Colorado farmers to locally grow the plants in Colorado's pristine soils and sustainable greenhouses. The flowers are run through environmentally-friendly alcohol or CO2 extraction systems. Some of our products feature the resulting broad-spectrum concentrate, while others require more refined oils and isolates. Bluebird's final products are made in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs). We test every batch using third party labs before delivering to your front door. Bluebird Botanicals proudly sources its hemp from sustainable farms in the US. A few years ago, the 2014 Farm Bill was signed into law by former President Obama. This re-established the legal cultivation and marketing of hemp on US soil through state agricultural departments. Now, the 2018 Farm Bill has officially removed hemp and hemp-derived CBD from the Controlled Substances Act, making it fully federally legal for the first time in over 40 years. *Due to state regulations, Bluebird does not currently ship products to South Dakota.

We are a smaller family than we used to be, but, I hope, and I believe, much closer than ever before. I prefer small and close to big and disconnected. Hello friends, To give our Boloco family a chance to rest, relax, and enjoy family and friends we are closed December 24 and 25 at all locations – same as last year. Next week we will have reduced hours in the evening (closing no later than 8pm in most locations). Over the past year we have been slowly rolling out changes to our ordering process and pricing. While many guests appreciate these changes, there are always those who don't – often for good reasons."

I cannot emphasize how grateful I am to have your support. TERI SILVA, PRINCIPAL, PERALES ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, CITY EDUCATION PARTNERS' INNOVATIVE SCHOOL FELLOW ""Thank you, Burnam | Gray, for a dynamic strategic planning session with our Board of Directors and staff in July 2018. Our group was delighted with your ability to get the room thinking, talking and planning together toward a common strategic vision. Our organization will now have a strong five-year plan to direct our strategy. This would not have happened at all without you and the (amazing) work you are doing. Burnam | Gray is available to lead training and conference sessions, webinars, or in-depth workshops for your nonprofit staff, leaders or Board of Directors. Whether it is a few hours, a full day or a series of workshops or webinars, we will tailor our presentation to fit your needs and your audience. We have developed and facilitated full Board of Directors' retreats and staff sessions. Because Remaining Silent is not an Option. The reason why we (Carrie, John, and Kate) are passionate about strengthening nonprofits is that deep down, we are passionate about serving the underserved. Seeing justice reign for the oppressed. Giving a voice to the voiceless. That's what really drives us every day. And, we believe that nonprofits have the power to bring people together united around these core principles. We can't begin to understand the anger, rage, and fear that racism has caused. Our hearts are heavy. We are feeling helpless. We are not making this statement just to make a statement. In reality, our words fall short. But, we feel that it's more important to speak out than to say nothing at all. We realize that this is not just a ""today"" thing. It's not just a trending hashtag. We are putting into writing what we need to say so that we can continue to hold ourselves accountable. So that you can hold us accountable. We recognize our insufficiencies, our lack of understanding, and our weaknesses. But we know that by preparing ourselves, creating a safe space for dialogue, engaging in conversation, and working together, we can be better. We want to be better. Our nonprofit partners are on the front lines. We stand with them and believe that through their power, passion, and their strength we can fight institutional racism and build a better future for our communities. This means challenging institutional oppression and racial discrimination. This means constantly asking ourselves tough questions, challenging assumptions, searching our motivations, and questioning our actions. We will do everything in our power to use our voice, our talents, our experiences, our partnerships for good. We will keep our eyes open to those being discriminated against. We will seek ways to create safe spaces for dialogue. We will speak up when we seeminjustice or acts that lead to injustice. But most importantly, we will listen. We have been working with a few of our nonprofits on reimagining their virtual events, and have created a planning guide based on what we've learned."

The view from the top is always worth it. To many, success only can be defined as receiving recognition for all your dedicated efforts, making career advancements, or reaching your individual accomplishments. Whether we stressed over an exam as an adolescent, or about any of life's daily responsibilities as an adult, everyone has experienced it at some point in their life. Long winter nights provide the perfect setting for adventure planning. Music on, maps out, beers cold and warm memories flowing; we prepare, map out and count down the days until our next adventure. I sit and imagine the trek, the solitude, the good sweat and the hard earned views coming our way. I didn't think so. A couple months ago I came across an article that really resonated with me. It touched on several aspects of the world of benefits that I live in every day. The article supports its opinions by referencing some of the industry's top brokerage firms. The standard answer is health care cost trends continue to outpace inflation. It's been one year since I returned to work from maternity leave after having my first baby. I distinctly remember in the Burnham kitchen putting my lunch in the refrigerator that morning when a coworker of mine, who is also a mother, walked in. It has been an incredible experience to watch technology boom over the last 10 years. Smart phones, tablets, and the ""world of glass"" concept are adding a sense of convenience in our daily lives. I recently had the opportunity to sail through the Panama Canal and it is quite a wonder of the world.

There's a spirit that wants to rally around good causes and good ideas, to kindle that flame, whether it's a hospital or a way to save energy or a place where friends unwind after a week of fighting the good fight. It's been our privilege to have partners like this, and we have grown with them. We were never in this for fleeting glory. We're in it for good. If they weren't, we'd call them something else. Here's a sampling of our latest solutions. We agree, it takes a village. In our case, it's a village of young warriors, wise elders and ranks of talented folks in between. Total population: 20, plus or minus. Our town square is called the Craniak Lounge and we hope to see you there sometime soon. Anri Sugitani, a.k.a. our Miss World. You see, Anri is of two nationalities and has moved every three years of her life. Due to her diverse upbringing, Anri loves to travel and eat; her personal rule is that she must try food twice before making a judgment. Her ad career began in L.A., with clients like Wonka, Raisinets, and Butterfinger. At CK, she manages accounts focused on healthy living—yes, she's aware of the irony. As a senior account manager, Anri always keeps her clients' work moving forward in an on-strategy, on-time, on-budget sort of way. Between on-s, Anri is usually on a mission to find Portland's best fried chicken and sushi. Likely answer: Almost anywhere. As director, producer, and shooter for most all CK video productions, Chapin travels the Northwest capturing the assets we need to produce some pretty cool television commercials and web videos for our clients. When he's got what he needs, Chapin returns to the darkness of the CK editing suite to coerce all his captive pixels into performing on command. Then, next thing you know, Chapin is on the road again. Hope he says hi to Willie for us. Account Supervisor is just one of Christina's many titles. She's a Master Juggler, Chief Organizer, and her favorite, Mom. Over the years, Christina has managed accounts for several clients with intricate structures and complex communications needs. She always manages to tame the many moving parts and help clients meet their communications goals. Success is certain with Christina, because she gets everyone and everything moving in the same direction, whether it's managing a digital campaign for a company of 4,000 or getting dinner on the table for her family of four. And she doesn't stop there. Christina spends her free time volunteering at the Oregon Food Bank, teaching families how to cook nutritious, affordable meals, because she's happiest when she's helping others. Erin leads CK's design team, overseeing creative strategy. She excels at delivering messages to audiences using compelling visuals with staying power, whether that's concepting ads about energy efficiency and renewable power, or launching a new craft brewery brand. Good design is thoughtful and has purpose, and she allows that process to develop organically, always to the client's benefit. Her eye for design goes beyond the office, from woodworking with her dad, building everything from coffee tables and gameboards, to designing a ""street piano"" with her mom for neighborhood kids to paint. The logo should pop more. As CEO, Jeanie is responsible for overall guidance of the agency. Her collaborative nature typically brings others into the decision making process—a key factor in why Coates Kokes is known for its highly positive and inclusive culture. Jeanie's career path began in Portland in the seventies and then looped through the eye-opening San Francisco ad scene before reconnecting to Portland reality. Along the way Jeanie picked up a keen taste for all things high design and a killer recipe for sourdough bread. Karli landed in Portland after several years living and attending college in Utah, where she enjoyed hiking Zion on the weekends, and did her best to avoid the snow. She was a natural fit for CK's creative team with her printmaking, painting and design skills. When she's crafting or experimenting with new art styles, she's often listening to her Americana playlist, including Miss Dolly. When the work week is over, she can be found seeking out Portland's best music hall, baking specialty cakes or visiting her mom in Gearhart on the Oregon Coast, exploring the beach with her two older sisters and Bron, her ""mini"" and exuberant Bernese Mountain Dog. Her last Halloween costume, a vintage fortune teller machine, won her the cash prize. Originally from Georgia, our peach of a receptionist comes to us by way of California where the daily sunshine grew a bit boring for her taste. As CK Office Manager, Kellie is part of our 3-person admin team keeping order in kitchen and all around world headquarters. Whether we need something cleaned, copied, filled, filed, ordered or returned, we know we can all count on Kellie to make it happen. Off campus, Kellie is currently working on developing her quilting skills—blue is her favorite color. After earning a degree in Journalism from the ""O"" down in Eugene, Kevin immediately went on to another esteemed ""O"" as a press assistant to the Obama for America campaign. Then it was on to Netflix (he says he's seen everything worth watching... and plenty of things that weren't), before making his way back to the greenery of his native Oregon and the Senior Account Manager position at CK. And here our ""Good is Contagious"" cadre of clients allows him to do just that. Lance gives ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"" some stiff competition. It's not unusual to find him sporting a bowtie, wielding a mystery novel in one hand, and ping pong paddle in the other. His favorite foods are tapas—don't act surprised if he orders them in Spanish. His approach to PR is refined (like a Manhattan—his favorite drink) and precise (like his billiards shot). He first learned to ""bring home the bacon"" from his pig farming days. A self-proclaimed ""coffee slinger"", he always knows how to handle the scoop—whether it's coffee beans or in media relations. As Veep of Ops, Lindsay's in charge of anything that can possibly go wrong. The way one gets named to such a high-ranking position is to know something about everything by way of starting at the front desk and working your way through every single department in the agency. And that's exactly what Lindsay did beginning back near the early dawn of CK history. Now we trust her so much, we let her manage the money too. Lindsay is downright excellent with a calculator. Although Maureen is one of our two agency media directors, she is the only one with a hyphenated last name. As such, she's double good at planning, placing, and post-buy evaluating media for our clients. Maureen is excellent with numbers preceded by dollar signs and exceptional at delving into the aspects of one of our favorite media terms: ""psychographics."" Simply put, she gets inside the consumer's head. When not performing media brain surgery here at CK, Maureen runs an urgent-care media business on the side. As one half of our media powerhouse, Meghan is fully fluent in both traditional and digital media. So whether your ad should appear in a magazine or on one of today's umpteen different screens, Meghan will get it all figured out. Media maven title aside, Meghan is best known as the CK mother of ""Bring Your Dog to Work Day,"" an annual event involving Bantry, Barkley, Belle, Roger and Pork Chop turned Petunia. All woofers receive a special award and a canine cookie made from Meghan's secret recipe. As president and strategic director, Steve leads the collective client-agency team effort to unearth the most salient strategies for clients with both cause-oriented and business objectives. Steve's career path first began with deep-dive stops at notable S.F. and L.A. agencies. Lured home to Duck-land in 1992 (Steve is a boastfully proud UO Journalism graduate), Steve has ever since been artfully demonstrating his Mad Men strategic abilities here in the Northwest. Sue leads the agency's PR team, including media relations, writing of all types and sponsored content creation. She's also a seasoned pro in crisis communications and reputation management. Her career has been an impressive journey through the halls of PR firms and local/national government. When it comes to PR, Sue can handle it all. When she's not speaking with reporters or advising clients, she enjoys spending time with her three daughters and husband. She can be spotted exploring the city's natural areas and viewing urban wildlife, excitedly sending candid photos of racoons, beavers and deer to friends. Tony is a former musician turned developer magician. Though he can still knock out a pretty mean guitar, these days Tony's work is all about helping us orchestrate an amazing digital strategy for our CK clients. Get it right and POOF!... just the right message magically appears at just the right time at just the right place—a digital screen gazing back into the eyes of a wanting audience. In 2006 B.K. (before kids), Tony and his wife spent a year travelling the world. Now their travels are closer to home helping two young daughters navigate the alphabet and master the art of forming the perfect Z."

We are a sustainable, eco-conscious restaurant and bar, using seasonal, organic when possible, ingredients that reflect our commitment to the environment and, especially, marine life. Our relationships with Long Island fishermen have been nurtured and supported through our sister restaurant, South Edison, in Montauk, NY. Crave was the first NYC partner of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, a national leader in ocean sustainability, as well as one of the charter members of the JBF Smart Catch Program. In 2016, Crave Fishbar joined just a few other restaurants world wide and became a certified B Corporation, solidifying our commitment to using our business as a source for good and to better our community. Therefore, we give our Pledge that food and drink consumed at Crave Fishbar is fresh, creatively prepared, of the highest quality and has been harvested with integrity. Jason Steinthal first made his way to the Crave Fishbar team after a successful two year run with chef Todd Mitgang opening South Edison in Montauk. He jumped at the prospect of sharing creative, fresh, sustainable seafood with the masses of NYC. A lover of all things eating and drinking, Steinthal brings a deep appreciation for restaurants as he heads up the front-of-house, inviting Crave's staff to share his passion. As the curator of Crave's wine program, Steinthal has put together an eclectic mix of interesting terroir and lesser known grapes alongside many carefully selected standbys. Steinthal, a native of Scarsdale, New York, got his start at City Winery in Soho, working his way up from barback to bartender to bar manager. Realizing it was time to make a move to somewhere more focused on finer dining and seasonal cooking, he took a bartending position at Keith McNally's Pulino's on the Bowery when the restaurant opened in 2010. Soon after though, a mutual friend introduced Steinthal and Mitgang, and South Edison opened later that summer. When not at Crave, you can find Jason eating pastrami with Russian dressing and cole slaw, most likely while complaining about the Knicks or the Jets. A native of Bayside, Queens, Brian Owens grew up in the Manhattan pubs and restaurants his father owned, winding his way through every aspect of the business from the kitchen to the host stand. His ability to plumb the moment for current trends while keeping an eye on ""what's next?"" has made Crave Fishbar a local haunt as well as a dining destination. While pursuing an MBA in Accounting from Hofstra University, he started working with his uncle, first at the Midtown lounge One51 and later launching another project in Chelsea, Suede. At the tender age of 24, Owens opened the Gallery Lounge at The Gershwin Hotel. When he met chef Todd Mitgang, Owens knew they had a hit on their hands with Crave Ceviche Bar and its distinctive menu of global ceviche. After the tragic crane accident, Owens was determined to reopen in the same neighborhood and Crave Fishbar was finally born in July, 2012. Executive Chef Todd Mitgang is the creative force behind the innovative, sustainable seafood menu for which Crave Fishbar has come to be known. With over a decade of culinary experience in a multitude of gastronomic settings, Todd brings great variety and bold flavors to his food. Todd graduated from the University of Buffalo before enrolling at the French Culinary Institute. After a stint as Executive Chef at Lisenda (now Ruby Room) in his native Roslyn, New York, Todd accepted a position at the Soho's critically acclaimed and consumer-popular Kittichai in 2004, where Mitgang's work with Executive Chef Ian Chalermkittichai played a major role in forming some of Mitgang's signature flavor profiles. He then met business partner Brian Owens in 2007 and they opened Crave Ceviche Bar in Midtown Manhattan. When the restaurant was tragically destroyed in a crane accident in 2008, hopes were high that Crave would return to the neighborhood as soon as possible. The team however, was not able to immediately find a new home and Todd went on to consult for various projects in New York including Cascabel Taqueria before opening his Montauk seafood shrine South Edison in 2010. There is so much that goes into Crave Fishbar. In so many ways, we are the sum of our partners. As the restaurant has grown, we've found a multitude of like-minded, passionate vendors and companies that each play their part in helping us to put together the unique Crave Fishbar experience. Some are old friends while others are new relationships we have cultivated along the way, but we're proud to partner with some of the finest food purveyors, oyster farmers and sustainability organizations in the country. Midtown's Octo Room: Our private upstairs room with its loft-like vibe is the ideal setting for any event. With a capacity range of 8 to 80, we at Crave Fishbar are versatile enough to host at our place or yours.

In 2021 there are an estimated 150M people experiencing homelessness in the world, part of an estimated 1.5B people with inadequate or insecure housing. We believe that this will only be further exacerbated by current global issues including housing supply shortages, regional conflict and climate crisis. This commitment creates a framework for our work that will long outlast the firm's founders and builds towards a shared legacy that we will leave behind together. With our exceptional staff and our incredible client-partners, we will create high quality housing to serve this enormous need. These homes may be created exclusively by our firm, but more often will be the result of complex partnerships where we are a service provider or part of a joint venture. Haven: A shelter for safety + refuge. Haven Ventures exists to increase the quantity and quality of housing options for under-served communities 800 N Mangum Street, Suite A, Durham, NC 27701 | ©2021 Haven Ventures."

I left for college with my mother's salad dressing recipe and ever since, it's been my secret for whipping together something out of nothing in an instant. We have something for almost every dietary need or preference. The best flavor comes from the simplest recipes ones that really let great ingredients shine. That is why everything in our dressings is recognizable like olive oil, balsamic vinegar, dijon mustard and fresh garlic. All our dressings are based on my mother's classic vinaigrette and her guiding principle that less can be beautifully more. So much more to the story than just salad. It's no secret we're a little obsessed with salads. So if you're not quite sure ""what to wear"", visit our Recipes page for endless inspiration [a fairy godmother transformation].

America locks up more people than any other country on earth, and it doesn't make us any safer. Not only that, the system is racist too—so if you're a person of color, you're much more likely to be arrested and sent to prison (for a longer period of time) than a white person who did the same thing. Ben & Jerry's thinks it's time for a change. Instead of spending our money on police and prisons, we should invest in people and communities. That belief is at the heart of Justice ReMix'd, and we worked with Ben & Jerry's to bring the campaign to life through videos, photography, blogs, and animation, on their website and all social-media channels.

Democracy Is in Your Hands The Ben & Jerry's Democracy Is in Your Hands campaign bridges the divide between two historically different but intrinsically connected issues: the movement to expand voter access and voting rights and the movement to get big money out the political process. Ben & Jerry's wants to activate citizens to take action for a more equitable and just society by building a democracy that works for all regardless of race or income. They're these little self-contained pockets of deliciousness whose sole purpose is to bring frozen delight to our mouths. With 2014 ranking as the hottest year on record (until it was surpassed by 2015...), Ben & Jerry's said enough is enough. Believers that businesses have a responsibility to promote social change and progress, they began a campaign to empower their fans to fight climate change. Defining themselves as a ""social justice company that just happens to sell ice cream,"" Ben & Jerry's came to us to help spread their message of climate justice and to empower their fans to take action immediately. On September 21, 2014, Ben & Jerry's took to the streets at the People's Climate March—the largest climate march in history. Millions of people marched at over 2,600 events in 162 countries to demand change from leaders in the United Nations. The People's Climate March was just the beginning for Ben & Jerry's.

Our experience with Echo Adventure Cooperative was excellent. We are senior citizens who are unable to hike, but we wanted to see the park and learn about the wildlife, plants, and geology. Elizabeth matched us with Kevin, who was an excellent guide, and so knowledgeable and passionate about Yosemite. We enjoyed a full day experience, touring the valley in the morning and the high country in the afternoon. And there was no evidence of smoke from the recent fires. Blue skies all day. We can highly recommend this tour group. We... hiked off the beaten path and in the water, had such an amazing time.... Bryant was so great at being thorough, repetitive, and patient. We appreciated his kindness and his passion for fly fishing. Elisabeth was great on helping us get booked for this awesome adventure and packed us the most delicious lunch after our fly fishing adventure ended. I'm so glad we booked the private tour for our family of three rather than trying to navigate the highway and seek our trails ourselves or rather than joining a larger tour. Jamie gave us an absolutely perfect one day trip to Yosemite visiting the stunning highlands along Route 120.

Ellevate events, particularly our annual forum, encourage the flow of knowledge and strategies between members. There is a tangible ROI to being a part of the network. I joined the network because I wanted to be a part of a community of vibrant, dynamic women. I've stayed in the network and am a proud Chicago Chapter Leader because I believe in supporting, investing and serving this community of vibrant, dynamic women. Ellevate has been instrumental in building my network as well as my company's advisory board and investors. The organization has given me the opportunity to lead a chapter and give back to the community through education. I joined Ellevate when I was searching for a women's organization comprised of women committed to helping each other achieve their success. From the moment I connected with Ellevate, I have felt as though I were adopted into a family of 34,000 women who care about me and my impact in the community. The network has helped elevate my career by teaching me, through example, how powerful a force for change a group of similarly motivated women can be. With one of our globe's greatest assets – women's brains – being underutilized, it is a refreshing honor to be part of a global group changing that in so many ways and across so many industries. I couldn't have built GoldieBlox without the help and support of others. Ellevate cultivates a culture of networking with other women, that is not only good practice, but instrumental to growth and development both personally and professionally.

Richardson's pragmatic approach to sustainability for SME's is filled with information, strategies and tools you can apply immediately. Over 98% of companies in the world are SMEs, yet they are the most challenging to engage in sustainability initiatives. This books fixes that dilemma. Its plethora of real-world examples will help SMEs see that smart sustainability strategies give them a competitive advantage. So many small businesses are paralyzed, without guidance on what to do, how decisions impact the environment, and where to even start. In Ethical Profit, Samantha Richardson has done the work for you. Outlining changes from small to large, Richardson provides the ""how-to"" that will break the paralysis and jump-start you, and your business, into action — by destroying the myth that environmentalism is costly. Available in paperback and eBook formats. Samantha Richardson has melded her passion, personal life, and profession to become an expert in environmental finance. Her second book, Ethical Profit, is the manifestation of her expertise. After graduating from Queensland University of Technology with a Bachelor of Business, she followed family tradition and became a third-generation accountant. She has worked in accounting for over 15 years across three continents. Her desire to have a greater impact on people and small businesses led her to open a small accounting office where she became the second accountant in Canada to be a certified B Corporation. Outside of accounting, Richardson is passionate about caring for the environment. She strives to reduce her carbon footprint through cycling, avoiding single-use plastics, and offering consulting to other small businesses on how to live and operate more sustainably. That is, they want to do their part to make the world a better place – including producing products that don't harm the planet, ensuring that all the people in their supply chain are treated fairly, and being a good place to work – while also turning a profit. It's such a radical departure from ""business as usual,"" that it requires a whole new approach to how to do business. But if applied well, the ideas in this book can help businesses be more successful – including financial success."

figloans.com,001C000001XeM1YIAV,Fig Loans,2017-09-29,2017-09-29,certified,"Fig Loans was founded by two Wharton Business School graduates who were frustrated that high-interest payday loans were the only emergency funding available to subprime borrowers. John Li and Jeffrey Zhou were determined to create a model of responsible lending. A model that would align business returns with the financial health of the borrower.
 
Today, Fig Loans does exactly that. Fig maximizes their profit by building up the financial health of their customers. Their model starts with the Fig Loan, a socially responsible alternative to predatory payday loans that was designed in collaboration with United Way of Houston and incorporates the CFPB’s small dollar lending remedies. The loan serves as an entry point and naturally transitions into a longer-term credit building product.

In the short term, Fig provides a socially responsible, credit building alternative to payday loans. In the long term, Fig helps improve consumers’ financial health by building their credit up so they can access affordable mainstream credit products. In this way, Fig offers Americans with bad credit a second chance to rebuild credit and regain access to traditional credit products.",Credit Provider,Financial Services,Socially Responsible Lender for the Underbanked,United States,Texas,Houston,Service with Minor Environmental Footprint, 1-9,bcorporation.net/directory/fig-loans,2017,88.2,21.6,34.9,2.8,13.5,11.8,0.8,3.6,0.5,0,0.7,1.8,,,,7.2,,2.3,,7.0,,,,,,2.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.1,0.5,,,,,1.1,0.0,,,,30.0,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.6,,0.5,,,,1.1,,,,,,,,0.6,,4.0,,,,,,2.7,,0.4,,0.0,3.2,,1,2364,"Fig partners with Family Houston to offer you a loan that is 60% cheaper and designed to get you out of debt. Fig helps you through financial emergencies and build credit towards a better future. Compare a $300 loan over 4 months... Fig offers a lower rate and fewer payments, giving you a fair price and a repayment timeline that works within your budget. Since 2016, Fig loans have built credit, helping you access more affordable credit in the future. We have no hidden fees or fine print. The rate you see is exactly how much your loan will cost. Modeled after home loans because it works, pay the same amount each month and after the last month your loan is paid off. Stephanie ""I enjoyed the flexibility of moving my loan repayment when funds wouldn't appear till a few days later. You don't get that with other loan services. I have already shared the name Fig Loans with friends who need help. James ""The best part of my experience with Figs Loans was the flexible payment arrangements.

An advance of money obtained through a payday loan or auto title loan is not intended to meet long-term financial needs.

Stocks soared near pre-pandemic levels while virtually all the major economic indicators – jobs, incomes, corporate earnings, consumer confidence, overall growth – continue to struggle mightily as the coronavirus pandemic rages on. The second quarter of 2020 has also brought a powerful resurgence of the movement towards racial equality, and a fast-growing number of investors now focused on investing for racial justice. The US-based S&P 500 rallied 20.5% for the quarter, leaving it down just 3.1% YTD. The global MSCI All Country World Index was up 19.4% for the quarter and down 6.0% YTD. In the meantime, US GDP declined 5% in the first quarter and is now expected to decline 8% for the year overall. Those projections have gotten worse, not better. As the chart below shows, US jobless claims have improved but unemployment remains much higher than it was pre-pandemic, with an exceptionally uncertain outlook. Much of the rise in stocks can be attributed to massive and unprecedented government stimulus. The Federal Reserve has lowered the federal funds rate to essentially zero and provided liquidity across the economy, while the $3 trillion+ stimulus from Congress has flooded the economy with cash. We now know that a lot of those funds have gone to entities already flush with cash, which then (at least in part) stash it away, in turn ballooning money market funds and stocks. In some ways, the rise in stocks is an indicator of the failure of ""stimulus"" cash to get where it can be put to real productive use: to cities as they rethink and rebuild infrastructure, to schools and universities as they retool to operate in new ways, and to businesses (small and large) explicitly to protect jobs. Stocks are also rallying because they look increasingly attractive relative to bonds, now yielding historically low returns. Stock investments in the largest corporations, with their huge balance sheets and easy access to all that liquidity, appear to be benefiting most. Big companies are best positioned to survive and even thrive from reduced competition as smaller companies are unable to weather the tough economic conditions. In addition, stock prices are being driven by faith that science will develop a vaccine in coming months, which, like so many parts of our economy, is very uncertain. Coronavirus continues to lay bare the enormous inequities underlying the US economy, especially for people of color. The virus is disproportionately affecting both the health and livelihoods of minorities across the country. A staggering 41% of all Black-owned small businesses have closed since March, and the racial gap in unemployment has ballooned with June unemployment rate standing at 15.4% for Black workers vs. 10.8% for white workers. We're now in the midst of a massive movement for racial equality – perhaps the largest the US has ever seen — and investors have a role to play. Here are things we are doing across investment portfolios at Figure 8: 1. We're investing a portion of fixed income assets into Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and other entities charged with the mission to direct capital to underserved people and communities. When you see that your portfolio holds investments in entities such as Capital Impact Partners, the Low Income Investment Fund, Self Help Credit Union, and Calvert Community Investments, know that you are part of the movement that is investing for racial justice. 2. We're joining with other investors to demand large-scale change, and are a signatory to the Investor Statement on Coronavirus Response and have endorsed Racial Justice Investing and its Investor Statement of Solidarity to Address Systemic Racism and Call to Action. 3. We're using our (your!) shareholder voice in calling on major corporations to take action. Figure 8 was one of 87 signatories asking Nike, FedEx and Pepsi to terminate business with the National Football League's Washington D.C. franchise if it did not stop using the name ""Redskins"" – a change that as of this writing has just been announced. 4. We continue to help guide and facilitate clients' charitable giving targeted at dismantling systemic racism and promoting economic justice. In addition, we are committed to integrating racial justice into Figure 8's investment decision-making and across our own operations. One thing we'd like to highlight is our banking partner, Self-Help Federal Credit Union, which for four decades has provided financial access (and we'd add, terrific service!) to people of color, women, and underserved communities. Like many other CDFIs, Self-Help has been instrumental in getting Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to places of greatest need, having processed 1600 loans, 80% of them under $150,000 and 51% going to borrowers of color. You can read more about Self-Help's overall impact here. The bottom line is that access to money and finance is at the heart of challenging systemic racism. We at Figure 8 commit to being part of the solution, and to using our unique role as investors to shift the balance of wealth and to promote economic and racial justice. If you'd like to learn more about our work at Figure 8 or how you can get involved with investing for racial justice, please don't hesitate to contact us. We'd love to hear from you."

They have adopted a holistic approach to teaching personal finance wellness. This approach not only empowers people with money management lessons that can change their lives. It also builds global awareness about the financial literacy movement and initiatives that become sustainable over time. Education: The NFEC is a 100% independent educational organization. The materials they have created focus solely on improving the financial capabilities of individuals and communities. That is, the NFEC curriculum, lesson plans, and/or speakers never serve as commercial tools to sell products or services. All their resources are based on the latest research and best practices for financial education. The NFEC has chosen a social enterprise business model. Thus they make their financial education resources available complimentary to a wide range of audiences including individuals, teachers, schools, colleges, financial professionals, and non-profits. These financial literacy resources have been created with one goal in mind: to improve financial capabilities. From preschool kids to mature adults, classes and curriculum are available for participants at any life stage. All the courses that make up the NFEC curriculum programs are practical in nature. While participants learn about personal finance, they also rehearse important skills they can apply to real-world situations. People from all demographics feel empowered and entertained by the fun games and activities these classes employ. Participants in the NFEC's financial education courses have reported feeling much more competent to manage their own money. All the financial education assets the NFEC promotes were developed in collaboration with a Curriculum Advisory Board comprised of respected financial literacy experts, educators, and financial professionals. The NFEC's extensive resources include curriculum, lesson plans, speakers, a certification program, consultation services, and technical assistance to obtain grants and other funding. Awareness: No program can achieve success if no one knows about it. That's why the NFEC's business plan demonstrates a commitment to raising awareness about the financial literacy movement. Promotion and advocacy form important pieces of all NFEC initiatives. The targeted individuals and communities become involved in the financial education process, maximizing program reach and impact. When schools and other community groups enter into partnership with the NFEC, they gain access to high-profile media messaging and celebrity endorsements that allow them to reach and influence more people. A further channel through which to spread the financial literacy education message can be found in the NFEC's Personal Finance Speakers Association. This group is the first money management speakers' bureau to be founded at the national level in the U.S. This speakers' association provides trained, motivational personal finance speakers to speak at events all around the world – from financial education for children events to keynote financial literacy events for those in the financial literacy industry. Sustainability: Another NFEC prime objective is to ensure that its campaigns are sustained in communities over time. One of the best ways to build sustainability is making sure the financial education resources continue to be cutting-edge and effective. Collaboration supports sustainability as well. By aligning financial literacy programs with the objectives of school and college clients, non-profit groups, sponsors, and other partners, the NFEC secures long-term support to give financial education lasting power.

They’re setting a higher standard for corporate responsibility in an industry that’s infamous for its inefficiency.

With their shared truckload service, they take a familiar concept (sharing) and apply it to the industry to help shippers and carriers create optimal shipping outcomes. By giving shippers the power to decide how their freight moves and incentivizing carriers to travel efficiently, the shared truckload approach flips the outdated freight system on its head and offers a revolutionary alternative.

When journalists report factory collapses, worker abuse, child labor, etc., it is not only news to the public – it is news to the brands responsible. At Fox & Robin, we do not believe ignorance is bliss. Our supply chain policies and practices (e.g. no subcontracting, in-person audits, a slow fashion model, etc.) ensure we only work with ethical partner factories."

Individual consumers know the story; wholesale organic cotton t-shirt buyers are sending a message to their customers each time they produce an old favorite or introduce a new idea. Finding wholesale products online can be super easy, thanks to the internet, but finding products that are ethically and sustainably made from a company with admirable customer service can be challenging. This is where Gallant comes in. Organic Cotton is produced using natural processes that have a lower impact on the environment. According to the Textile Exchange, ""Organic cotton is cotton that is produced and certified to organic agricultural standards."" Organic Cotton combines ""traditional, innovation and science to benefit the shared environment..."", it also sustains soil's health. As much as we try to reduce waste there are few things we cannot avoid wasting, like vegetable and fruit scraps, eggshells, coffee grounds, and more. Businesses should take responsibility to put people and the planet first while educating their employees, customers, and investors about their efforts.

We wish to foster the development of an integration of business, culture and community. Formerly Mount Royal Spinning Company then Dominion Textile, Complexe Dompark is located on St. Patrick Street on the Lachine Canal and is 467,000 sq. ft. Bought in 1995 as a bankruptcy repossession with approximately 70% vacancy, it was occupied mainly by industrial tenants at acquisition. Our flexible and client-centered approach allowed Complexe Dompark to offer a unique product to the office market that is well suited to many types of creative businesses such as: multi-media, TV Production, graphic design & photography, professional offices such as architects, engineers and software development, and showrooms for the clothing and sporting goods industries. Originally built by the Sulpicians, with the help of local volunteers as a staple for the community of Little Burgundy in 1861, St. Joseph's Church was an inclusive place to meet, celebrate and find support. Overtime, the church fell into economic hardship and the community was faced with a challenge to save this breathtaking building before losing another part of its history. Le Salon 1861, a Je Fais Mtl initiative, was built to reconnect people to collective space and break the silos between sectors of our society. Formerly the Simmons Company mattress factory, Complexe du Canal Lachine was built around 1919. Located on the banks of the canal, near the Atwater Market, the building covers an area of over 367,000 square feet. The building was nearly abandoned when it was bought in 1993 from bankruptcy. Improvements and major restorations were undertaken to build more than 250 commercial lofts, making Complexe du Canal Lachine one of the first buildings and creative eco-systems of its kind in Montreal. Located in the heart of Griffintown, between Guy, de la Montagne, Barre, and William streets, this 400,000 square foot property, perfectly suited for commercial and light industrial-use tenants, is leased at 99%. Owned by local investors, Quo Vadis was mandated to negotiate the acquisition of the property and has oriented its redevelopment to include the most appropriate use options for the space. In parallel, Quo Vadis will be creating a new walkable, vertical village developing along the principles of a ""triple bottom line"", valuing Profit People and Planet. Natalie Voland has been thinking outside of the ""traditional"" real estate box for more than 20 years of hands-on management. With her social work background, she has created a unique vision that uses real estate projects as a tool of economic development and urban regeneration and her projects have led to the creation of over 3,000 new jobs. She is passionate about taking single use, historical buildings and retrofitting them for entrepreneurial purposes. As a Quebec leader in social innovation through BCorp Certification based on triple bottom line practices, Natalie works collaboratively with strategic partners to redevelop communities. She holds a portfolio of approx. 1.5 million sq.ft with over 500 SMB's, including start-up incubators and advocates for leadership of inclusions. Her latest creation is retrofitting of one of Montreal's oldest churches into a hub of social innovation called Le Salon 1861, which uses business skills and contacts to help integrate residents of Little Burgundy, non profit community groups, Universities, with business leaders to use collective experiences to rebuild Montreal.

I've had a lot of trouble with burning and itching during intercourse for a few years due to bad lubricant and lack of foreplay. What's been the most frustrating is not being able to climax. Restore has helped many of my clients with recurrent BV [Bacterial Vaginosis] and has provided a safe, effective and natural product so many women desire. I myself have tried the Restore product. I was absolutely blown away by the end results. I have never used any such product and saw such outstanding results. I refer all my patients to it. I'm a doula and childbirth educator who frequently works closely with couples experiencing sexual dysfunction after childbirth.... I was always afraid to use any type of lube with my partner. I'd heard of chemical rashes and other unruly things happening and dryness. When I heard about Good Clean Love, I immediately wanted to try it and using [Almost Naked] was the best decision. My wife has a high sensitivity to chemicals and gets yeast infections extremely easily. For literally YEARS we have been working our way through the commercially available lubricants looking for something that works well and doesn't cause her issues.... We used [Almost Naked] last week, and the next day my wife said to me, ""I don't know what lube you used last night, but I liked it. It felt good, and no issues afterwards. It even smelled good."" I cannot tell you how sweet those words were to hear. My wife and I have been together for almost 31 years, and I feel like we've just been given a new lease on our love life.

VERY SOON, ALL ON-SCREEN PRODUCTS AND ASPIRATIONAL BEHAVIOR WILL BE SUSTAINABLE AND ETHICAL, INSPIRING A GLOBAL SHIFT TO CONSCIOUS LIFESTYLES. IT IS SIMPLY A MATTER OF WHO WILL JOIN US IN TAKING THE LEAD. Our mission is to facilitate a paradigm shift in the entertainment and advertising industries toward sustainable production and event practices as well as inspire conscious consumer behavior by integrating sustainable, healthy, and ethical products and brands in major movies and television shows. As most of us in production are aware, our industry is incredibly wasteful, sending thousands of tons of waste to landfills every year, much of which can be re-purposed, recycled, donated, or composted. Good Planet Innovation is guiding the shift to sustainable practices, both behind the scenes and on screen. Providing consultation and hands on support from pre-production to post, Good Planet finds sustainable solutions for every department, from art department to catering, from the office to transportation. Enabling positive, eco-friendly operations behind the scenes without compromising the production's timeline, budget, quality, or safety goals. Good Planet analyzes every department on each individual project to generate a customized sustainability plan that is both highly effective and attainable within the budget and scope of the project. In addition to the robust programs during productions, we will manage and coordinate donations of everything from sets to wardrobe to leftover catered food, keeping nearly all of it out of the landfill, often making the production 'zero-waste' while supporting the local community. Our sustainability initiatives will save the production money in many departments, provide tax receipts for the donations, and create valuable positive PR content for the project and company. As filmmakers, we also have powerful influence on our audiences and can use that power for good through conscious product and behavior integration while maintaining and even enhancing the integrity of the story. Good Planet Innovation provides full spectrum brand integration and consulting services to help you inspire a positive shift in your audiences' behavior well after they have enjoyed your film. Brand and product integrations are becoming increasingly effective ways for brands to reach consumers. We leverage these opportunities exclusively for sustainable and ethical products. In addition to our other services, Good Planet Innovation also works closely with our brand clients to help market their products in a variety of ways. We leverage our relationships to identify sponsorship opportunities that increase the brand awareness of our client's products and develop sales pitches to prospective businesses. Additionally, we participate in gifting suites before a variety of movie and music award ceremonies to expose our client's products to A list celebrities. We will soon be announcing an exciting initiative that will give ethical brands global exposure while supporting important causes.

They are very professional, and I would recommend them to anybody. Rafael E · I truly value having a warm, cozy home that is heated efficiently with very affordable energy bills. Thank you for the great product and outstanding service. Jamie K. Home energy efficiency in Portland and Bend, Oregon What's the most cost effective way to make my home more energy efficient?The answer depends on the details of your home. What matters most for you could be attic insulation, wall insulation or floor insulation; it could be a new furnace, ductless heat pump or heat pump water heater. To get a prioritized list of upgrades, complete with pricing and cash incentives, you should schedule a home energy audit. This is the best way to understand how your home works and what you can do to improve the comfort, safety and energy efficiency. Depending on your project, you can take advantage of cash incentives from Energy Trust of Oregon as well as state and federal tax credits. GreenSavers handles the paperwork needed to process your incentives and tax credits. This is done at no extra charge. As a trade ally contractor with Energy Trust, we have the highest rating 3 out or 3 stars for customer service and quality performance. GreenSavers is a dedicated home performance contractor. That means we take a systems approach to home improvement. When we recommend an upgrade, like wall insulation, we dig in to understand how that upgrade will impact even seemingly unrelated areas of your home, like bathroom ventilation. It's critical to make sure that your home has just the right amount of air flow Not so much that you're uncomfortably hot or cold, but not so little that you get an accumulation of moisture or carbon monoxide that can make you sick. To understand our approach to home improvement, please watch the video overview of our home energy audit and perhaps check out the Home Performance Report and Indoor Air Quality Report included in the audit. Tell me more about the insulation materials you use. We choose environmentaly responsible cellulose insulation and fiberglass insulation. It's worth perusing our insulation materials page, but here's a quick overview. When installing attic insulation and wall insulation, we use a product called Greenfiber cellulose insulation. Greenfiber is made with 85% recycled paper fiber. We use 2 different types of fiberglass insulation for floors and attic kneewalls: CertainTeed fiberglass insulation and Knauf EcoBatt® fiberglass insulation. CertainTeed has a plant-based binder with no formaldehyde, harsh acrylics, dyes or unnecessary fire retardants added. Knauf EcoBatts are made with at least 50% recycled glass content. The main tests that we perform during a home energy audit in Portland or Bend include: (1) blower door test, (2) infrared camera scan, (3) combustion safety test, (4) gas line inspection, and (5) indoor air quality assessment. We also do a visual inspection of the windows, seismic risk, and solar potential. What you get is a detailed breakdown of the priorities for comfort, safety, and efficiecy, complete with information about pricing, cash incentives and tax credits. Our ductless heat pump page is a good place to start. A ductless heat pump, also known as a ductless mini split or mini split heat pump, is the most efficient heating and cooling system on the market. We install Mitsubishi ductless heat pumps. In Bend, clients typically install ductless heat pumps to improve the efficiency of their electrically heated homes. In Portland, clients go ductless to make living spaces usually upstairs bedrooms more comfortable. The designed lifespan for most furnaces is 15-years. That's not to say that your furnace will stop working after 15 years, but rather, it's efficiency will start to drop significantly at that point. You can learn more aobut the energy efficient Rheem furnaces that we install by visiting our furnace page. You have a lot of options for cooling in Portland and Bend, Oregon. If you're considering an air conditioning system, the first thing to know is that central air conditioners are more efficient than room air conditioners. They're out of the way, quiet, and convenient to operate. To get the most from a central air conditioning system, it's critical to consider both proper sizing and quality of installation. Take a look at our windows page. GreenSavers is a proud distributer for Milgard, a Pacific Northwest company that offers a lifetime guarantee on all windows. We find that Milgard, which was founded in 1958, strikes the right balance between performance and cost for windows in Portland and Bend, Oregon. It's important to choose the right water heater for your home. A standard electric water heater uses more energy than a refrigerator, dishwasher, clothes washer and dryer combined. If you have an electric water heater, especially one that's 10 or more years old, you should consider a heat pump water heater, which uses about 3-times less energy. If you have a gas water heater, consider upgrading to a tankless water heater (also known as an on demand water heater). A tankless system delivers a constant supply of hot water without the use of a storage tank. It's the most efficient way to heat water at home. Our seismic retrofit page has more information, but the first thing to consider is the age of your home. If it was built before the first seismic code in 1978 and it hasn't had a seismic retrofit, then chances are that you're not ready for a major earthquake. When we do a seismic inspection, we check the gas lines, sheer walls, water heater, and foundation, including connections between the home and foundation, support beams and footings. Our clients get a full breakdown of options and costs for gas shutoff valves, foundation bolting, and water heater strapping. If you're interested in residential solar in Portland or Bend, you should call to schedule a solar assessment."

The uniquely southern culture of our port city establishes the foundation for our passion of creating great beer. For those who have never had the pleasure to meet her, Marianne is the ""Goddess of Liberty"" that once stood on the top of the 1889 Mobile County Courthouse. Accompanied by the eagle that sits at her feet, Marianne is the face of our Saffron Saison, which uses saffron sourced from Afghanistan – in the hopes of turning opium poppy growers into saffron farmers. With the guidance of Marianne, we're combining a global mission with a local face and fighting terrorism with beer. Description: Our IPA's citrus, floral taste is a welcomed balance to a style that's well known for being bitter. This beer is more romantic and less offensive than its contemporaries. Description: This Saison is spiced with saffron grown between the mountains of Afghanistan. By choosing to source this ingredient, we give Afghan farmers a choice. A choice to grow saffron instead of opium poppy. Description: A smooth dark beer that pairs well with the hot southern climate. This porter finishes with a nice coffee-like flavor that you would almost think came directly from coffee, but it doesn't. That flavor is the direct result of high quality roasted malt. Haint Blue Brewing is positioned in a unique location in historic downtown Mobile. Housed in the old Crystal Ice warehouse, the brewery property is separated from the burial place of Joe Cain only by a 19th century brick wall. The downtown Mobile skyline sets the perfect backdrop to stop in, relax and enjoy a beer. While stationed in Washington, the brewery's founder, Keith Sherrill, enjoyed the culture of the brew houses nestled at the base of Mount Rainier—one of the most fertile hop growing regions in the world. When moving back to his home state of Alabama, he wanted to bring that culture he enjoyed so much with him. That began the pursuit to create great beer in an even greater city. Haint Blue takes great pride in more than just brewing beer. We currently have a pending certification as a B corp, a designation that requires for-profit organizations to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. We strive to be more than a brewery. To be successful, we believe that we have a social responsibility to support the community that supports us.

Pasture raised is the highest level of humane certification. It means each hen gets over 108 sq.ft of personal outdoor space (bigger than an average bedroom)—perfect for foraging, dust bathing and stretching their wings. It's a stress free, happy environment for our hens. It's better for animals and the planet: no GMO's in the feed, no pesticides or chemicals in the fields or feed, no antibiotics for the hens—nothing unnecessary for a healthy, delicious egg. On a pasture raised system, organic is the most sustainable method of production. WE'RE CHANGING HOW WE EAT, FROM THE GROUND UP. At Handsome Brook Farms, we believe the food system needs to be rebuilt. Our current system was built for scale and size only. As a result, there are too many animals treated poorly, too many chemicals on our lands and it's too difficult for small farmers to survive. By clustering small family farms in specific regions and picking engaged, committed farmers to join us—we're able to produce more, higher quality eggs than the current system while meeting the highest standards of animal welfare and sustainability. Our hens know our farmers so well, it's like they're part of the scenery. Familiarity with the flock is important in helping identify issues and maintaining health and quality. Just about every part of our operation involves personal attention. This includes collecting and packaging eggs twice a day for shipment to our facilities. There is no place our hens would rather be than out on the pasture in the long summer evenings. Unlike other production methods, pasture raised allows hens to act like hens. Jeremy and his brother took over this family farm from their father. Their home is on the north side of the pasture and as you can see, they are pretty friendly with their girls."

From Hawaiian Outrigger Canoe and Ocean Kayak Tours to private Surf and Stand Up paddle board lessons, Hawaiian Paddle Sports provides guests with unique, authentic, and intimate ocean experiences. Through its variety of ocean activities, Hawaiian Paddle Sports empowers thousands of guests each year to develop a deeper connection to Maui and the marine environment.
 
Recognizing the importance of creating a sustainable, marine-based eco-tourism model, Hawaiian Paddle Sports launched in 2010 as a company committed to reducing its environmental impact and promoting sustainable practices within Maui’s tourism sector. Through private tours, professional guides, true ecotourism, and a commitment to community, Hawaiian Paddle Sports not only provides an unparalleled guest experience, but also supports the local community and a healthy ocean ecosystem.
 
As an ocean-based activities company, Hawaiian Paddle Sports makes its living off of the ocean. We therefore recognize the importance of giving back to both the environment and community, while also taking care of our employees.

Rated #1 on Maui 2010-2016 ""..Let start off by saying I really didn't know IF I was going to be able to Surf in Maui, but I knew I Surfing Lessons were on the top of my list of things to do. I had no idea it would be so easy... ok the Surf Instructor probably had A LOT to do with that. His instructions were clear and detailed..."" ""This company is epitome of what service should be. They were great at communicating via email and by phone prior to our arrival in Maui. We booked a private kayak tour for 2 and had a wonderful time...I highly recommend you try!"" ""...Hawaiian Paddle Sports is absolutely, hands down, the only company you want to work with for paddle sports on Maui. They were friendly, kind, patient and can provide multiple different Paddle experiences. Our guests learn the answer after spending an incredible adventure being away from the crowds and off the beaten path. All our tours and lessons are tailored to you and your party. Experience an outrigger canoe or Maui kayak tour off our pristine shores. Maui paddle boarding tours give you a great perspective of the reefs. And private Maui surf lessons by our professional local guides will have your group ready for a surf safari in no time. Your Maui experience should not be compromised at the expense of a company's profits. Large group tours are not for everyone and a one size fits all style has been adopted by too many Maui activity companies. This is why Hawaiian Paddle Sports was created, to offer private, authentic and educational ocean activities with an emphasis on the guest's overall experience. Our professional local Maui guides are Certified Marine Naturalists who are passionate about protecting you and showing you the waters off of Maui in equal measure. Choose below from our private tours and locations to begin one of your most memorable days on Maui. Our PRIVATE Maui Surf Lessons get you away from the crowded ""Maui Surf Schools"" in Kihei, Lahaina and Kaanapali to a more secluded surf break where our Surf Instructors can take the time to teach you how to surf... not just stand on a board. We offer private surf lessons in Maui with no more than 5 guests to 1 instructor ratio. If your party has more than five surfers we will send a second surf instructor. We guarantee you'll get up and surf in one easy lesson or your next surfing lesson is FREE, that's how confident we are in our instructors. Whale Watching is a must if you're lucky enough to be in Maui December through April. Now the question is how. If you're on our website, you are probably not the type who will be satisfied being crammed on a catamaran, or even larger whale watching boat, with hundreds of people. Our private whale watching tours get you close to Humpback whales without disturbing them with a loud engine or massive boat. We'll paddle out with you on a kayak, stand up paddle board or outrigger canoe to let you watch these gentle giants in their natural environment. With the lack of crowd and engine noise you'll hear them as they exhale and send a spray of water into the air, commonly referred to as a spout. You could potentially see pec slaps, fluke slaps, spy hops and whale breaches. We often encounter newborn calves, with their mother and escorts, where we can watch them for hours without disturbing them. Sometimes we get a real treat and have a competition pod swim by with several male Humpback whales competing for a female to mate with. Every day is different and we never know what to expect when it comes to the whales or the marine environment. However, you can always expect the best experience with Maui's top guides who are safe, passionate and educated on all of our Maui paddle sports tours and lessons. If you're coming in the Summer months to Kayak in Maui and go snorkeling with Green Hawaiian Sea Turtles then we offer four beautiful locations: Makena, Olowalu, Honolua Bay, Molokini Crater. Each location offers a unique experience and our staff can help you choose the best location for your experience and fitness level. No experience is required, our dedicated kayak guides will take the time to make you feel comfortable even if it is your first time kayaking or snorkeling. If you're fit and have experience our guides can take it up a notch and make sure there is plenty for you to see and do as well. Again, a PRIVATE Kayak Tour in Maui allows you to have the experience you choose. If you'll be visiting in the winter months and wish to Kayak Maui, we offer two great locations for Kayak Whale Watching: Makena or Olowalu. There is no better way to go whale watching in Maui then from an ocean kayak. No crowds, no engine noise or diesel fumes... just you, your kayak guide and the Humpback Whales. Stand Up Paddle Boarding on Maui is a great way to explore Maui's scenic coasts and bays. Choose from one of three locations, again each offering a unique experience and view of Maui: Kapalua Bay, Olowalu or Makena. We realize that everyone comes from different backgrounds, fitness levels and comfort in the ocean which is why we offer exclusive and PRIVATE Stand Up Paddle Board (SUP) Tours. You will be able to Stand Up Paddle as far and as fast as your ability allows, without having to feel like you're being held back or holding others back. Or if you choose to just leisurely cruise around and check out Green Hawaiian Sea Turtles that's fine too. Oh, and our Stand Up Paddle instructors will take photos for you at no added charge so you can just enjoy your morning on the water. Unlike our exclusive and private Kayak Tours, SUP and Surf Lessons, on our Hawaiian Outrigger Canoe Tours we do combine parties in order fill all the seats in the Canoe. There are 6 seats in our 45 foot long Hawaiian Outrigger canoe and 12 seats on our Double Hull Canoe, one for the guide and rest for all the engines.... that's you, so the more engines the better. These tours are very similar to our Maui Kayak Snorkel and Whale Watching Tours but with a cultural element. Experience Hawaiian Culture first hand as you paddle a traditional craft and hear legends of Maui from your canoe guide. Learn to make rope from coconut fibers just as ancient Hawaiians did to lash their canoes or wa`a together. Learn about the migration of Polynesians to Hawaii from distant lands and how they not only survived, but thrived in Hawaii. Again our guides will document the entire adventure and send you photos after your Maui Outrigger Canoe Tour so you can enjoy the experience without being distracted by taking photos. Experience the incredible rush as you and your group are pulled along by the waves in an outrigger canoe. Canoe surfing has occurred as long as there has been canoes on the ocean. Often the ancient mariner's time their landings based on tides, beach accessibility and the waves that would quickly and safely bring them close to shore over shallow reefs. Unlike our other tours which are private, outrigger canoeing and the canoe surfing tours are group events. Partnering up with others to fill the canoe is required for launching and catching the waves. During your surfing experience your local guide, a certified marine naturalist and lifeguard will be steering the canoe and taking photos for you to share with your family and friends for free. All photos and videos on this website were taken while viewing animals from a responsible distance. Images depicting dolphins or whales in close proximity to people were taken when the animals approached the vessel, and no attempt was made to approach or otherwise disrupt these animals. All underwater photos and videos of dolphins and whales were taken with a remote device while following guidelines for responsible viewing."

Every strategic planning process is unique, depending on the needs and capacity of the organization. Our team, led by seasoned facilitator Steven Hobé, will craft an approach that is tailored to your organization. Our job is to engage with you, the experts in your field – to guide, motivate, and inspire a successful, cohesive and grounded strategy. Our first step is to set up for success by reviewing previous plans, engaging with internal stakeholders (staff, volunteers etc.), identify strategic issues that will be addressed, and assess the current satisfaction of your beneficiaries, customers, donors and/or membership. Next we move on to developing the strategy itself. Here we revisit your organization's Mission, Vision and Core Value statements. We solidify your unique position within the sector, and establish successful strategies and objectives that span either a three or five year period. Here we deep dive into a SWOT analysis to determine your Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. We also determine short-term organizational goals, department and team member goals, and KPIs to track progress. We then align a one-year budget with the plan. Finally, we rollout the plan to the whole organization. We set a schedule to establish progress reviews, hold modification sessions quarterly, and an annual review. Our shared goal is that your strategic plan engage, as well as motivate both current stakeholders and future prospects. If you are planning to launch an awareness or fundraising campaign, create a new website, or rebrand your organization, it all begins with Strategy. Marketing Strategy analyzes the current state of your organization, the external environment in which it operates, and then drills down into segmenting your market, targeting and positioning your brand. Led by seasoned facilitator and strategist, Steven Hobé, your team will brainstorm through different marketing frameworks, from the upper level thinking of the 5 Cs (Customers, Company, Competition, Collaborators, Context/Climate) to the tactics of 4Ps, also known as the marketing mix; as well as formulating a set of KPIs (key performance indicators) that can track your success through statistical anaylsis. Strategist & CEO, Steven Hobé is a Chartered Marketer. The Chartered Marketer (CM) designation is awarded by the Canadian Marketing Association, recognizing the top marketing talent in Canada and fostering a community of continuous learning and skills development for the profession. We determine the current strengths and weaknesses of your brand and then ensure a re-design that has true impact in your industry. This process includes logo creation, language & tone style guides for publications, colour theme / palette, photos & stock library expansion, and fonts development. The key is to ensure cohesiveness and consistency through all mediums, while staying true to your organization's goals and objectives. There are many factors that lead to a successful campaign, the first being to carefully consider what forms of media you'll leverage, your key messaging, and rollout. But success also rides on building a core team of experts to drive this process forward. We collaborate with you to showcase your organization through the creation of marketing materials; as well as leveraging both earned and paid media channels through targeted public relations. We pride ourselves in keeping our fingers on the pulse of what's new and innovative; and conversely, on what forms of media are no longer trend setters. We offer a wide range of digital strategies, from website design and social media to the development of apps, e-learning modules, and KPIs (key performance indicators) to track your progress.

Fish waste products are recovered at our facility and reused as fertilizer by local produce farmers. Delivered directly to your door. Shop our fresh fish, carefully harvested for your enjoyment. 1. Our fish production methods (Recirculating Aquaculture System) do not discharge into the environment. Fish waste (uneaten food and feces) from sea cage systems are released directly in the surrounding areas of the farm. This waste can build up directly underneath the cages on the ocean floor causing havoc on the natural ecosystem. 2. Our fish are not exposed to environmental pathogens. Fish farming in sea cages can promote the introduction and amplification of pathogens and disease in wild fish populations. 3. No Drugs & ChemicalsOur fish are free of hormones and chemicals. Sea cage aquaculture methods that expose fish to external organisms rely on the use of chemical additives including antibiotics, hormones, pesticides and anti-foulants. The use of antibiotics has been correlated with elevated bacterial resistance in the environment and also infectious bacteria resistance in humans. 4. No Impacts on Predator PopulationOur fish are not grown in contact with other forms of marine life. Techniques required to keep predators at bay in intensive sea cage farming can cause net entanglement and other adverse impacts on local marine life. 5. No EscapesFish cannot escape from our RAS system. Escapees from sea cage operations can compete with wild fish for food and habitat, transmit diseases and prey on and breed with wild fish thus reducing the health of the wild stock."

With Image Relay: Everything is in the right place and people get the content they need at exactly the right time. You get back more time for your favorite things. Rated the #1 digital asset management software. It is your secret weapon. It gives you back time. Before: Dave from Sales asks you for some logo files to use in a sales deck. He's confused and asks for the wrong size the first time, so you have a back and forth over Slack to get him what he wants. After: The sales team has access to all the right content. They grab what they need when they need it. Before: You need an illustration for a new set of ads, but you can't remember where you saw it last. After: All of your organization's content is in one place, organized in a common sense folder structure, with metadata and tags adding context for speedy searching, and advanced refine tools to find what you need in seconds. Before: Melody, a freelance photographer, mailed you a hard drive. You have to plug it in and download the files to your desktop and then select which ones can go on the shared drive. This time it's not too bad, it's only 200 photos. After: Photographers and agencies use upload links and can quickly share the photoshoot or other work to a staging folder, adding metadata and tags in the process. You receive an email when the job is done. Before: Another request from the sales team, this time it's Taylor. They want to know if they can use a photograph they found on the shared drive. You're not sure so you have to track down the release form. Turns out that the image license is expired. After: All assets can have expiration dates based on license rights or any business need. Assets also have metadata fields for rights information, informing each user of approved use. And that release form, it's attached to the asset so it never gets misplaced. Before: Your marketing director wants to see a group of images for the new campaign. You gather them together and add them to an email. They take up too much space. You're going to have to zip them. You know how much your boss hates dealing with zip files. After: Share a folder or create a Collection in moments. You can send 1 file or 1000. Your users see large image previews, contextual asset information, and can download any files they want. No zip files necessary. Before: An urgent request comes in from a partner. They need a product image ASAP for a deadline. Not only did you get an email but also a text to make sure you saw it in time. You have to put down your book or hit pause on your favorite show to dig up some files. After: Easy access doesn't stop with your team. Outside partners can get what they want when they need it, 24/7, from anywhere in the world. It's that self-service thing again. These types of late night requests are a thing of the past. 2 hours stolen from your day. 2 hours back in your day for your favorite things. We're not just a product.

Posted in What We're Reading. NPR reports on dicamba drift overwhelming Midwestern pesticide testing labs. Dicamba is a Bayer Monsanto-manufactured herbicide that was approved for use by the EPA in 2016. Dicamba is sprayed on genetically engineered soybean plants that are resistant to the herbicide and survive, while surrounding weeds die. Since its implementation, dicamba has faced harsh criticism because of its propensity to drift. Pesticide drift has long been a danger to organic farmers. It's one reason that organic farmers use buffer zones often planted with trees and hedgerows to create borders around their fields from neighboring conventional fields. Pesticide drifting into an organic field can mean that the crops grown in the field cannot be sold as organic. It can also mean the loss of organic certification for the acreage, which requires farmers to take it through a three-year transition period again. Dicamba drift can also be a danger to other conventional growers, who may be growing conventional soybeans, but not dicamba-resistant soybeans. Drift from dicamba can mean death and crop loss for their conventional soybeans. This report highlights how widespread dicamba drift is and how ill-prepared local authorities are to deal with the problem. Drift and the complications that arise from it is only one issue relating to pesticide and herbicide usage. We also know that it contributes to much more, which can be explored in depth on Pesticide Action Network's website. As a company that supports organic farmers, we believe that we must end the use of pesticides and herbicides for the health of our food, soil, watersheds, and farmers."

Posted by Leanpath on July 9, 2020 A new global survey has found the majority of consumers expect food and beverage companies to focus first and foremost on ""doing the most good for society"" over ""satisfying consumer demand"" and that the primary means of doing good for society is reducing food waste. A new report from the UK's Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP) shows consumers are increasingly concerned about food waste as the COVID-19 crisis has led to a greater value placed on food. Data shows lower food volumes can lead to more food waste Posted by Brennan Hogan, Product Manager on June 10, 2020 As foodservice operations reopen from COVID-19 shutdowns, it is widely anticipated that service volumes will be reduced at the onset and increase slowly over months. While it may be assumed that less traffic leads to less food waste, a new Leanpath analysis shows just the opposite: on average, low volumes actually lead to higher levels of food waste relative to food purchases."

Numerous awards include ""America's Best Dance Band"" at the National Music Awards, ""Best Cover Band"" at the San Diego Music Awards, ""Pop Album of the Year"" at the Los Angeles Music Awards, #1 Cover Band at the Readers Choice Awards, Top Cover Band at the prestigious Spotlight Awards, Best Rock Band by the San Diego Reader and a Guinness World Record. Liquid Blue has performed in over 100 countries and holds the official world record for ""The World's Most Traveled Band."" This international act turned international cover band has performed sold-out, ticketed shows on three continents. This sought-after San Diego band for hire specializes in private functions, including Social Events, Weddings, Bar-Mitzvahs; Corporate Galas; Fundraisers and other formal gatherings. There are numerous San Diego dance bands for hire, San Diego party bands for hire and San Diego cover bands for hire but none have the international acclaim and recognition of Liquid Blue. If you're looking for a Wedding music band in San Diego, or anywhere in California, Liquid Blue is among the very best music bands in the world. They were by far the highlight of an already amazing week. We are so happy with how everything went, Liquid Blue were the heroes of our favorite memory ever. Each time I've hired Liquid Blue they have totally captivated the audience. This is due to their talent & preparation. They send out questionnaires, find out what the client's needs are, rehearse, prepare timelines, have extensive sound checks etc. so that everything is perfect before they ever walk out onto the stage. They recently performed at the biggest Fundraising Gala in Tulsa and went way above and beyond normal expectations. It was a USO themed event and they had the older guests out on the dance floor, within the first song (this just doesn't happen anymore). When the party music started it was standing room only for 2 hours nonstop. If you have an important event then go with Liquid Blue if you want it to be flawless. This is the second time in two years that we've had the pleasure of Liquid Blue's no-break, non-stop 4-hours of rhythmic sounds and unbridled energy in New Orleans. This entertaining, high-energy band has music for all ages and do a fantastic job of layering multiple genres of songs into fun, energetic and musically profound medleys. Liquid Blue is amazing to work with and always exceeds our expectations. This is the third year that we've hired the band to play at the annual Hong Kong Tatler Ball and they just keep getting better and better. We had guests young and old dancing the night away. I highly recommend this band if you want to get your guests out of their seats and onto the dance floor. I have been around music my whole life and in the business of booking/managing talent in the past and this group is exactly what we needed. It was a honor to have this band perform on behalf of our company and we hope to book them again in the future. Hands Down one of the best cover bands I have witnessed. We had Liquid Blue for our summer wedding and were blown away by the outcome. Fantastic doesn't begin to describe them. The caliber of their group is top notch. Everyone one was dancing, and they didn't take any breaks. Everything from planning ahead of time, to learning our first dance, to rocking it the day of was above professional. Don't settle for 2nd tier wedding bands. We have hired them twice now and both times they have been such a hit. They get people moving and having fun instantly. They play a wide variety of songs to connect with all ages. They are so professional and easy to work with. Liquid Blue headlining the 65th anniversary of the Los Patronas Jewell Ball, was amazingly creative and versatile – they showed commanding intensity and artistry combined with a smooth synchronicity that looked absolutely effortless on stage – engaging the guests with an incredible performance that rocked the dance floor""til the last note. Liquid Blue is much more than a group of performers – this is a multi-talented band of extraordinary entertainers. Dancing went non-stop until 1AM. I had read all the great reviews about Liquid Blue being ""The Entertainment Act of the Year"" and ""Best Party Band, Best Cover Band"" but truly I cannot say enough as to how amazing they were for our Fundraising Event. Professionally, I handle Sports Celebrity Events all around the Country which entails booking the actual Bands that Liquid Blue covered and I can say with full confidence that Liquid Blue performed their songs equally (and in some cases, much better) to the original Artists. They were entertaining, constantly engaging and most of all, got our entire group up and dancing...which has never happened in all the years of this Event. Our Board has already had discussions to just make Liquid Blue our performing act each year for our Event. During that time, this unique San Diego music band has become the most accomplished and requested party bands not only in Southern California but in the entire world. But don't take our word for it; read the reviews published online. Liquid Blue Party Band has received over 200 five-star reviews, more than any cover band in the business. Here are just a few snippets: ""What a sensational wedding music band!"" ""We hire this fabulous cover band every year and they have never let us down!"", ""Every performer was a star!"" ""We are extremely selective in hiring music entertainment for our gala events. No other party band has come close to Liquid Blue. They keep the dance floor packed all evening!"" ""Amazing band. The performance was interactive and high energy. What a show Liquid Blue put on for our New Year's Eve Centennial Event. We could not have asked for a more professional, talented and friendly group to be a part of our special night."" ""We searched all the best party bands in San Diego and chose Liquid Blue."

We present ten tracks of pure holiday merriment. Whether it's the awkward visit with extended family, that moment you realize your uncle's drunk again, or the fact that you left the tofurkey in the oven too long, there's something for everyone here. Since starting our Field Notes interview series this year, we've had the incredible opportunity to hear from our creative community of filmmakers and musicians. We've heard and shared stories about their experiences creating film, what worked, what didn't work, and ultimately coming out the other end with a powerful piece of art in tow. In effort to compile some insightful information from this past year, we present 5 ways that music is misused in film and what can be done about it... 1. Using one entire track from start to finish without editing. One common pitfall that filmmakers have with soundtracks is applying one song that spans the entire film. Tim Kemple—Co-Founder of adventure film company Camp4 Collective—agreed in our interview with him in October. We've all done it."" He continued by saying ""Music [is] a key component to evoking the right emotion in different parts of the film...Sometimes I'll go out and shoot specifically towards a song that I love. Other times I won't use music at all. Each film ebbs and flows with different emotions that require different moods from the soundtrack. Kemple expressed that filmmaking is not just about pretty pictures, it's about capturing a raw, human story with music weaving in and out of it. He shared a homework assignment: ""The next time you see a great film... close your eyes and just listen I suspect you'll find that the sound is more present then you ever imagined. Read the full interview with Tim Kemple here. 2. At Marmoset, we believe in real music crafted by real people. It just makes for better, authentic art. In our recent interview with filmmaker, Truen Pence of Instrument, he stated that he's ""not a fan of ""stock"" sounding music"" and thinks there's ""an ""Apple advertisements"" style of music that has become our new elevator music in our industry and I'm not usually a fan of it."" Pence concluded that he thinks ""we'll look back on this time period and get a laugh out of it. We pride ourselves with the amazing roster of bands that we work with and the soulful music they create. Real music has the power to move people, especially when it perfectly balances what's on screen. When reflecting on his work on the Levi's Commuter series, he stated that ""music has the ability to push the picture in a completely different direction. I like the juxtaposition of elements, pairings unexpected combinations of music and sound and feel those are the moments that you remember. Read the whole interview with Truen Pence here. 3. The creation of art is about taking risks. The collaboration of music and film is no exception. Filmmaker, Clayton Worfolk of Heist makes this point clear in our November interview with him: ""I think music is often used to set a tone as opposed to complementing what's already there. I think it's also easy to fall into the trap of playing it safe with music using the predictable genres of particular types of work."" To Worfolk, the perfect soundtrack is all about rhythm. Clayton's mini-documentary about prison baseball for The New York Times was all about rhythm and juxtaposition. He paired a serene and ambient soundtrack to the gritty landscape of San Quentin Prison. This created a powerful, unpredictable film that demanded the viewers full attention. Read the full interview with Clayton Worfolk here. 4. Music plays a critical role in supporting the emotional moment in a scene, not exaggerating it. Filmmaker, Will Saunders reflects on this point in our October interview: ""Music can be misused in film because it can conflict with what's actually being presented with what's actually occurring. You can force people a certain way through music, even though your film doesn't coincide with the mood."" He continued by stating that ""this is where pushing yourself to be an exceptional filmmaker comes into play. Music elevates film, but it does not dominate it."" We couldn't agree more. Saunders inspiring, personal portraits —including the one he made for UNC Health Care—lets both the music and visuals speak for themselves, creating one cohesive and inspiring film. Read the whole interview with Will Saunders here. 5. Mismatching music with the flow of the film Like each story has an arc, pacing and energy, films move in the same way. When the energy of the soundtrack isn't on the same page as the visuals, it can be a confusing viewing experience. Ben Fullerton, a filmmaker and Co-Founder of Caveman Collective proved this point with a story of his own: ""A little while back I saw a short piece that in many senses was very good– the characters, cinematography, and editing were all fantastic. But a few minutes in, the piece was obviously trying to build to a pinnacle moment, and the music just wasn't having it. Instead of supporting the drama and pushing it forwards, the music was acting like an anchor. As a musician himself, Fullerton takes the role of music in film seriously and found great use of our search filters to help him find the perfect soundtrack to his film below.

Somehow 2014 has already come and gone, bringing the world a treasure of incredible music - all time stamped and sealed over the past 12 months that were 2014. This year revealed impressive debuts from several new up and comers, while some returning stalwarts pushed themselves once again to impart the world with magical collections of sounds and inspirations. For us, reflecting on another year of music meant another visit to the Marmoset Deliberation Chamber, where our team banded together to assemble our annual list of albums. A list of records that kicked our ass in one way or another. Of course, there was the usual crying, arguing and hours upon hours of deliberations... which led to more crying and eventually led to hugging, which means we've all had too much whiskey. Yet, in the end, we're proud to come out the other end only a little whiskey-drunk - and with our favorites in tow. To make listening easy, we've assembled our Top 20 Records of 2014 (plus 15 Honorable Mentions) all into one easy to use Spotify playlist for those of you who enjoy streaming music and stuff like that. 364 songs and more than 25 hours of 2014 slam jammin' bliss to get lost in. And without further ado (or superfluous and non-sensical made up stories), our favorite albums of 2014... 1. Soaring to the top of our list is this tour-de-awesomeness. Hands down, no other record had as much wide spread love and appreciation throughout our lil' Marmoset team than this one. Likewise, no other record blasted out through our speakers more throughout the year. Racing out of the gates with sonic waves of lush guitars textures, songwriter Adam Granduciel and Co. have created another release full of fantastic psychedelic infused Americana (aka unapologetic ""dad rock""). Lost In The Dream was a poetic muse for our Music Licensing Coordinator, David Katz. He reflected that Mr. Granduciel is ""very aware of how time works with the human condition"" and that each song was filled with ""crisis and monumental mileposts of loss and heartbreak intertwined."" Damn. We've been geeking out to this album all year and our lil' Marmoset crew were equally mesmerized by their incredible barn performance at Pickathon last Summer. Listen on Spotify here: Lost In The Dream by The War On Drugs 2. There's throwback music...and there's Temples. After a widespread double take when learning that this was released in 2014, this music blasted us into the era of big hair and psychedelic rock. Sun Structures is a completely absorbing album that is the best psychedelic pop around right now. No one is a bigger fan in our gang than Music Supervisor, Ron Lewis. This album takes him ""to a meticulously-rendered heavy psych zone. It feels like a gesture of respectful homage to the era of Marc Bolan, Slade and Barrett-era Floyd. In a nutshell, it's the record the 'Dukes of Stratosphear' forgot to make."" Temples have invented such a strong aesthetic with their sound that it's undeniably something uniquely their own. Temples visited Portland on April 10, 2014 and oh man, what a night. Nearly the entire Marmoset crew converged on The Star Theater in Old Town and thankfully the band did not disappoint. Make sure to catch Temples when they next tour through your neck of the woods. Listen on Spotify here: Sun Structures by Temples 3. Resident avant-garde visionary St. Vincent came out with her jaw-dropping self-titled album on the heels of her recent collaboration with fellow weirdo David Byrne. Coming out with guitar sounds that no one thought would be possible to create, each track is layered with intricate, haunting and playful melodies combining sophisticated taste and talent. And of course she's a killer guitar player and vocalist."" Her music video for Digital Witness gets bizarre in the best way possible. Wading in an ocean of heavily-produced albums floats the recent offering from Angel Olsen as a beacon of lo-fi greatness. To say that Olsen's vocals are unique is an understatement. Her half-warbled, half-crooned delivery creates a solemn and satisfying atmosphere. Keeping things sparse and poetic, her lyrics are straightforward, leaving bruises on the heart of any listener. Burn Your Fire... left an impression on Business Affairs Coordinator, Beth Martin, ""I love the sound of her voice and the rawness of the whole album."" Raw is a fitting word and it we'll add intense into the mix, much like the prolonged eye contact she has during live shows. Get hypnotized with her captivating video for Hi-Five. Listen on Spotify here: Burn Your Fire For No Witness by Angel Olsen 5. Just when you think you have Ryan Adams pegged, he turns everything on its head. Consistently being one of the most prolific artists to date, Adams released five albums this year, all varying in musical direction. His self-titled, full length shines brightly as a beacon of well-crafted pop. As an artist with an ever shifting persona, he nailed it on the head with this one. Listen on Spotify here: Ryan Adams by Ryan Adams 6. Marmoset's Artist Relations and New Music Scout, Brandon Day summed up this album perfectly, ""Everyone's favorite gap-toothed goofball made one of the most endearing albums of 2014. Full of heart and cheap liquor. No smoke and mirrors just Viceroys."" Mac DeMarco is taking slacker-rock straight to the astral plane with Salad Days. The Marmoset crew caught DeMarco's set at Pickathon last Summer and we got full caught-up in the vibes, especially as he crowd surfed from the front, all the way to the back, and then back to the front again. All the while his band re-imagined their own, ""jizz jazz"" version of Coldplay's ""Yellow."" You had to be there. Equal parts creative filmmaker and talented guitarist, DeMarco has been known to craft his own brand of immersive multimedia experiences of unadulterated debauchery. His video for Passing Out Pieces goes back to the days of VHS tracking. Listen on Spotify here: Salad Days by Mac DeMarco 7. There's an eternal summer locked inside the music of Generationals. Each finely-crafted electro-pop track is an invitation to put on your best daisy dukes (or daisy dudes) and head out to the nearest body of water. Bright and glimmering with youthful joy, Alix is the perfect soundtrack for a mystical cruise ship sailing toward the endless horizon. This record ranked tops for Marmoset fearless leader, Ryan Wines, who explained, ""It's undeniably infectious, feel good, pop. Listen on Spotify here: Alix by Generationals 8. Dear Australia, You have outdone yourself when you produced the likes of Courtney Barnett. With equal parts gritty grunge and polished pop sensibilities, Barnett takes the baton from the likes of Kurt Cobain and hits the ground running with her stunning double EP. There is a lasting brilliance with her songs that speak truth to anyone in earshot. Marmoset's Artist Relations and New Music Scout (and mega-mega-fan of Ms. Barnett), Brandon Day believes that ""fans of gardening will especially be into this."" Take that as you will. Listen on Spotify here: A Sea Of Split Peas by Courtney Barnett 9. The music of Tycho is a direct extension of graphic designer, Scott Hansen. His music is like his visual art: sleek, minimal and meticulous. Awake lies in the middle of post-rock and ambient instrumental music. On any given day this year, it's guaranteed this album was a looping soundtrack in our studio. This was definitely one of the most immersive releases this year, moving in fluidity as one cohesive song and dream, snapping you back into reality when it's over. Chances are, our Creative Project Manager + Community Ambassador, Bob Werner is repping this album hard in his headphones right now. And truth be told, few records played more at Marmoset HQ in 2014 than this one. If you're looking for a soundtrack to do creative work to, this is it. Listen on Spotify here: Awake by Tycho 10. If Tom Wolfe's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test was written as an album, this would be it. The ramshackle ensemble from Chicago writes with wild abandon, creating the rules as they go. He continues by stating, ""It's unabashedly fun and a wicked display of four early 20-somethings letting loose with their take of garage-indie-pop and completely pulling it off."" Give into the madness with their video for I Found A New Way. Listen on Spotify here: Wild Onion by Twin Peaks 11. From first note to last, You're Dead! is an densely woven sonic tapestry. This album floored Music Licensing Coordinator, Katy Davidson and Community Ambassador Stirling Myles. Davidson eloquently reflects that ""this record sounds like a half-decade in music history blasted in a blender without the lid on. It's futuristic free smooth jazz prog fusion, equal parts earnest and sarcastic, moody as fuck, frantic, virtuosic, trippy, dissonant, urgent, and deep, i.e., it sounds exactly like it feels to live on this planet right now."" His collaboration with Kendrick Lamar resulted in one of the most powerful music videos this year. If you only have time for one video, please watch this one. Listen on Spotify here: You're Dead! by Flying Lotus 12. Beck has always had the ability to jump in and out of genres while keeping his own unique voice intact no matter what he's playing. Morning Phase is chill and expansive. Each track weaves together strings, guitar, Beck's signature-sounding voice, all washed over with a blanket of reverb. Music Supervisor, Nicole Wilson has been spinning this record all year. It reminds me of a hazy, warm afternoon in California. Beck is unapologetically himself and he created a record that isn't overdone, but is thoughtful and welcoming. I've always enjoyed his music, but this album is hands down one of my favorites if not my favorite that he's ever made."" Enough said. Yes, Taylor Swift made the list this year. Here's a couple reasons...First, 1989 was the only platinum-selling album this year and you have to give her props for that. Second, Swift was able to effortlessly ""shake off"" the ""coy girl"" image and elevated her impeccably-produced candy-pop to a matured state with this new album. Third, this record showcased her ability to make fun of herself, which is something rare. And besides, you know you've been singing her songs in the shower. Now, here's Swift looking absolutely insane in her video for Blank Space. Marmoset Co-Founders, Brian Hall and Ryan Wines, will be the first to tell you - very unapologetically - this record is absolute pop brilliance. It's true, the ""haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate..."" but this record is pop gold. 14. Over and over, Damien Jurado proves that all you need are four chords to convey powerful messages. Known best for his bare-boned approach to folk, he went a bit off the rails with this one. Brothers and Sisters... ventures into a haze of psychedelic bliss. His strong lyricism remains the same, just with welcomed experimentation this go round. We're huge fans of Jurado over here at Marmoset - especially our Developer, Ryan Rebo who says he cannot help but keep coming back to this record, time and time again. Summer Music Fest last August in Washington State, where he laid down a chilling soundtrack to the stars and moonlight and campfires, as 100-foot evergreens circled, and even leaned into the enchanting live performance. Man, that was one to remember. Listen on Spotify here: Brothers and Sisters of the Eternal Son by Damien Jurado 15. A couple of incredible moments in live music happened this year. And one of them was Future Islands' electrifying performance on Letterman. It's considered now as the most viewed musical segment on the show. Their own brand of 80's synth-pop and dance moves stunned the audience. The same goes for their inspiring new album Singles. Maybe it's the husky vocal delivery of frontman Samuel T Herring or the flawless combination of thumping bass grooves and space-age synthesizers, whatever the reason, this album always draws you back to it. Our Financial Affairs Manager, Jon Haas has even developed a high concept dance routine to each song. Listen on Spotify here: Singles by Future Islands 16. Showing some Portland love, our local friends and Marmoset Artists Rio Grands have written one of the most charming and eclectic concept albums of 2014. Going through the alphabet, this Tropicália infused album explores all the different types of NW relationships, using one woman's name as the hook in each track. A-Z was two years in the making. Three cheers to this amazingly tongue-in-cheek offering into the world. Check out Quinn, a song about ill-fated hippy love. Listen to the record here on Bandcamp: A-Z 17. This year's release from veteran bad ass Sharon Van Etten might be her best yet. Her own brand of folk rock runs the gamut of emotions all with a overarching umbrella of vulnerability. Each track draws you in and spits you out with heartache and joy. Studio Manager, Jessica Cassady is a huge fan, especially of the track Taking Chances and how it ""make[s] you feel confident."" Are We There is ""full of internal conflict and intimacy which makes it extremely personable. Listen on Spotify here: Are We There by Sharon Van Etten 18. Kye Kye has been a sheer force this year and it might have something to do with their incredibly epic and cinematic new album Fantasize. This band of relatives (and Marmoset Artists) are also local to the area, but you would never know since they've been kicking ass on the road and spreading their infectious and haunting electro-pop to the masses. We've been fans for a while now, and it's always amazing to see a band grow. Kye Kye not only gets better with time, they burn brighter and brighter with songwriting maturity that expands well beyond their collective years. Marmoset Leader Ryan Wines shared, ""It's been exciting watching Kye Kye grow and evolve over the years. Listen on Spotify here: Fantasize by Kye Kye 19. The story of Tinariwen is an intense and interesting one of turmoil and artistic freedom. Get caught up here. This Algerian based ensemble has been at it since 1979 and have blown the lid off in the states with Emmaar. Mixing together world beats and 70's psychedelia, they're sound is completely their own. Emmaar reminds us that we live in a big, diverse world full of beauty amidst tragedy. Listen on Spotify here: Emmaar by Tinariwen 20. This debut from Jillian Banks (aka Banks) is a powerful force. At once confident and complex, Banks' hypnotic and vocals move in and out of a blanket of lush trip-hop beats and lush synthetic textures. There is a drama and beauty within every song that presents a captivating alternate reality leaving the the listener in an atmospheric state of bliss. This album has a special impact on our Community Manager, Stirling Myles. He once confessed ""I like to to slow dance alone while hugging myself to this music."" Creepy.

We provide economical solutions where our customers realize real savings. Solar is an effective alternative to fossil fuels for generating energy, and it's an ideal solution for homeowners, commercial properties, and communities. Once the solar panels are installed, solar power provides a supply of clean, renewable energy and savings that continue to grow. For more than 16 years, MiEnergy has been a geothermal and solar company of choice, providing energy solutions for more than 1,500 residential and commercial clients, as well as communities throughout Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. In most cases, solar costs less than energy from the utility, so you can save on your bill. Going solar allows you to isolate yourself from any future power increases. The average solar system saves 2,500 trees, the same as driving 450,000 km. Not paying for power is not an option. Since you are paying for it anyways, you might as well have an asset to show for it. Save up to 80% each year on heating, cooling, and hot water bills just by switching to a geothermal heating and cooling system. Geothermal systems use no flames to heat your home, so dangerous carbon monoxide and gas leaks are eliminated. A single geothermal system is equivalent to planting one acre of trees or removing 2 cars from the road. It is not feasible to produce your own fossil fuels for heating, but you can generate your own power with solar. Going ""green"" does not have to mean ""expensive"". At miEnergy we provide only economical solutions where our customers realize operating savings. With rising utility rates, renewable energy technologies are the way of the future. Feel good about saving money and call us today for options. Solar panels are a proven way for homeowners to reduce electricity costs while adding value to their homes. What separates MiEnergy from other Saskatchewan, Manitoba or Alberta solar companies is our commitment to providing custom solar panel installations that continue to generate the clean energy our residential clients desire, for decades into the future. For business owners in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, solar companies like MiEnergy are your ally in reducing electricity overhead through the installation of commercial solar panels. We will help you make the most of underutilized areas on your property, installing solar panels that can offset or even eliminate your operation's electrical costs. More Reasons to Invest in Solar Power By investing in solar panels, Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan residents and commercial property owners can generate significant savings each month. Utility rates will only continue to rise, but solar panels from MiEnergy give you peace of mind and an estimated savings of $14,000 in the first 20 years after installation. With solar panels, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta homeowners can make a significant impact by utilizing 100% clean, renewable energy. The average home can save approximately 125 metric tons of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere over a 20 to 30 year period. A shared solar system is ideal for those who live in apartments, condominiums, or areas where there is not enough space to install solar panels. With community solar, municipalities and members of communities in Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan are able to share the benefits of solar power generated by the community solar farm. Farm operators throughout Western Canada are enjoying the many benefits of solar solutions that provide clean energy while also generating revenue. A geothermal system uses the energy of the sun, stored in the earth, to heat and cool your home all year round. Now's the time to make the switch to renewable energy solutions that include geothermal and solar panels. Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta home and business owners can speak with our team of professionals to better understand their needs and receive a custom design for their specific project. Work with a reputable geothermal and solar company in Western Canada to discover the renewable energy solutions that are right for you."

It directly impacts how you feel physically and how you take care of one of the most important people in your life — you. This is your life. You only get one to live. You can heal — for the people who care about you, for your family, and most importantly, for you. You can learn to cope, to embrace what's positive, to overcome so you too can enjoy this beautiful life. Getting out of bed in the morning, being successful, being happy, making changes to set yourself free — It's all possible. Let's take the first step together. You've come to the right place. The therapists at Move Forward Counseling take a person-centered approach. They want to see you succeed and will help you to find what YOU need in order to make your life more fulfilled. They aren't here to change who you are but rather to help you see the positivity in yourself that you may have overlooked. We'll help you discover the beautiful things about you and start you on a journey toward the strong, confident, happy person you can be. When you call to schedule with us, our intake coordinator will help to pair you with a therapist best suited for your counseling and insurance needs so that you can feel comfortable. We do accept many private insurances. We are happy to answer any questions you might have. Call us today to schedule an appointment."

It may not be in your power, may not be in your time, that there'll be any fruit. But that doesn't mean you stop doing the right thing. You may never know what results come from your action. At Nia, we go beyond the identification of strong products and services. Management practices and leadership composition matter. We seek companies where the executive team demonstrates a high-level of commitment to diversity, transparency, employee engagement, and ecological sustainability. All NGS portfolio companies have women in leadership on the executive management team and/or serving on the board of directors. Our depth and experience differentiate Nia. Our Equity Portfolio is carefully constructed of publicly-traded stocks from companies located around the world. The businesses in which we choose to invest focus exclusively on solutions for people and the planet, and range across the globe and capitalization spectrum. Our investment team selects securities determined to be among the most creative and positively-impactful, publicly-traded companies. In addition to choosing the very best companies, we actively advocate for diversity in leadership via proxy voting and corporate engagement. At Nia, we recognize the responsibility of stock ownership and to that end, we vote in favor of diverse boards of directors and the inclusion of female directors. We seek to vote all proxies on behalf of investors to ensure their voices are heard on important corporate policies and governance issues. As an example of our active voice, Nia voted to support the resolution filed by AIDS Healthcare Foundation to tie CEO compensation at pharmaceutical companies to access to medicine. We seek to communicate with all portfolio companies about the benefits of diverse teams and leadership, as well as to discuss relevant issues and concerns. We also seek to engage with companies that are working on innovative solutions, and yet are ineligible for the NGS portfolio due to their lack of diversity at the executive and board levels. We encourage them to add diverse team members, thus gaining potential eligibility as an NGS portfolio company. We seek to grant a portion of Nia profits to those non-profit organizations whose primary work is to foster and encourage corporate accountability. We also seek to support those organizations helping to transform our financial system to be more transparent and more equitable. Contact us for more information. (Check all that apply.)

NorthFork Financial emerged in the fall of 2011 to provide individuals and families with integrated financial planning and advisory services that are wholly independent from any firm or any investment products, that provide a transparent and flexible fee structure, and that are committed to helping people connect their values with their finances. After spending five years learning the industry as a Financial Consultant at a regional broker-dealer firm, Bill Stoddart wanted to create a firm that didn't follow the predominant model for providing financial services. At many firms across the U.S., a consultant's job is to figure out how client assets can generate income for the company. And how much ""production"" each consultant generates is often part of a larger contest within the company – this culture is very familiar to all salesmen and women; however, Bill didn't believe it was the right measurement as to how well he was helping his clients achieve their personal and financial goals. Perhaps Bill's perspective on helping his clients achieve their goals derives from his nearly ten years as a high school teacher helping his students succeed. As a teacher, he believed his role was to help his students acquire knowledge and to provide further guidance as necessary, regardless of the time or personal commitment required. So, when it came to talking with clients about their financial lives, helping them establish goals and educating them about the various tools available to help them move toward those goals – whether it was talking with them about credit, or real estate, or the securities markets, or budgeting, or career alternatives, it didn't seem right to Bill to be compensated through the investments his clients chose. Nor did it feel right to him that he was evaluated based on how much income he generated for the firm, not based on his relationships with his clients. One morning, Bill was thinking about how he would explain to his kids what he did for a living, and realized he could no longer do what he was doing the way he had been doing it. And so, after a good amount of research into alternative models and a lot of conversations with colleagues who had experience with other advisory models, he decided to make the leap to becoming an independent Registered Investment Advisor and created NorthFork Financial, LLC in late 2011. The name NorthFork stems not only from the geography of the area and the jump-off point for one of Bill's favorite wilderness pursuits, but it also represents a metaphor of choice and purpose.

Once upon a Farm was founded with the dream of providing yummy and nutritious ""farm-to-family"" foods to kids of all ages. This was the goal when Cassandra Curtis and Ari Raz started the company in 2015, creating cold-pressed, organic baby food and applesauces that parents would prefer over the highly-processed, shelf-stable alternatives. Soon after the company's launch, Cassandra and Ari were joined by award-winning actress, social advocate and mom, Jennifer Garner, as well as successful organic industry pioneer, John Foraker, previously the longtime CEO of Annie's Homegrown. Together the four visionaries grew the company with a goal of providing as many children as possible with the best tasting, most nutritious, and highest quality food utilizing sustainable methods. Now, Once Upon a Farm aspires to be a leading organic family food company that will fight for and support efforts to drive positive social change and food justice for the benefit of parents, kids and families. It's with this mission that Once Upon a Farm strives to nurture our children, each other, and the earth to pass along a healthier and happier world to the next generation. Compare this to our vibrant color and fresh taste. We use fresh local produce and healthy fats like coconut milk to help improve brain development, and our advanced packaging technology uses pressure instead of heat to kill harmful bacteria while simultaneously preserving the nutrition. The result is a convenient, truly farm fresh baby food. High Pressure Pascalization (HPP) or ""Cold-Pressure,"" refers to the process by which fresh food products, such as juice and baby food, are preserved as opposed to heat. HPP is a method of preserving packaged food products using extremely high pressure. The process leads to the elimination of any potential harmful bacteria while maintaining a higher yield of vitamins, minerals and enzymes, and preserving a fresher taste than thermal pasteurization. High Pressure Processing is recognized by the FDA for preserving freshness and increasing shelf life without preservatives.

Fresh, stone-ground flour has crazy-good-for-you roughage the way Mother Nature made it - not additives put in after the fiber-rich bran is stripped out. When wheat is stone-ground, it retains natural and plentiful vitamins and minerals. Industrial flour mills bleach out all of that goodness. Nearly all of America's wheat is grown in monocultures and fed pesticides and chemicals. It's really bad for our environment - even worse for our bodies. We source as much organic wheat as we can from Matt and Sara, our very first partners in Maine. In our first year of business, they grew almost 90% of the grain we milled. About half of that harvest was ""transitional"" (i.e. grown organically but on a field that hadn't yet been certified). And while 100% of their fields are organic now, we're proud that our partnership helped them convert. In year 2, we've expanded our network to include a couple other organic farmers from other parts of the country. Like Matt and Sara, they grow 100% organic and without pesticides. But, we're not forgetting about the importance of transitional. We think it's a critical step in helping to build the next generation of organic farms. This is bigger than bagels.

Opticos became a B corporation to find support in creating a business that better reflects our passions and beliefs that businesses should be socially, environmentally, and fiscally responsible, as well as to provide a successful business model to other firms looking to do the same. The name Opticos has its roots in the term “logos opticos” which was used by Viturvius in his architectural treatise, “The Ten Books of Architecture,” referring to the innate sense of harmony within well-composed visual information. The company's practice embodies this sense of harmony in the inviting public spaces and overall great places they create in their town planning practice, as well as in the well proportioned and comforting traditional and classical buildings they craft.",Architecture/Design/Planning,Building,Architecture and Urban Design,United States,California,Berkeley,Service with Minor Environmental Footprint, 10-49,bcorporation.net/directory/opticos-design-inc,2019,87.8,21.8,2.8,13.3,17.9,31.8,2.4,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,4.6,,,7.3,,6.3,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,2.8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.9,0.0,5.7,,,,,,,,1.7,,,,,,,2.7,,,,0.0,,,,,,1.7,,0.3,,5.6,,6.2,11.4,8.5,,,,,,,,,,1,2637,"Walkable, attainable communities people love to call home Opticos principal Daniel Parolek inspired a new movement for housing choice in 2010 when he introduced the concept of the ""missing middle"" in American housing. Today, Opticos creates innovative architectural designs to help build walkable communities with unique, diverse housing choices that are attainable for all. Opticos is a world leader in zoning reform for walkable, sustainable communities. We didn't create form-based coding, but we've been trailblazers in the field for more than 20 years. We are experts in understanding how the form of buildings will shape community spaces, and we can simplify the process of introducing form-based codes with a predictable build-out. On November 1, 2021, Memphis and Shelby County, Tennessee, rolled back a significant, but lesser noted regulatory hurdle to building missing middle in the US, by locally amending building codes to enable structures of 3 to 6 dwelling units to be reviewed by the city and county under their residential building code rather than the commercial building code that typically triggers at three units or more. For Andre Jones, a local builder and member of the City and County's Building Code Advisory Board, the push to become one of the first jurisdictions to review missing middle housing under the residential code could not have come at a better time. For one last time in 2021, the Opticos team gathered at the office to pause and reflect upon all that we had accomplished this past year. It was a wonderful reminder of the project milestones, professional development, team building exercises, and overall fun we had in the last twelve months as we resumed meetings in the office and travelled nationwide to project sites, community engagement workshops, and speaking events. Vertical construction on Culdesac Tempe is now well underway, with several buildings in the main entry plaza almost fully completed and future residents ready to make it their new home in 2022. The country's first car-free community built from scratch promises a vibrant, walkable community that includes a restaurant, grocery store and coffee shop, amongst other amenities. While it is hard to find these types of retail tenants, especially early on in a mixed use project like this, Culdesac not only made it a priority, but also made a special effort to find small, locally owned businesses to support the local economy and reinforce a unique experience within the Culdesac community for residents and visitors.

Patagonia, Inc.'s values reflect those of a business started by a band of climbers and surfers, and the minimalist style they promoted. The approach they take toward product design demonstrates a bias for simplicity and utility.

Build the best product
Their criteria for the best product rests on function, repairability, and, foremost, durability. Among the most direct ways they can limit ecological impacts is with goods that last for generations or can be recycled so the materials in them remain in use. Making the best product matters for saving the planet.

Cause no unnecessary harm
They know that their business activity—from lighting stores to dyeing shirts—is part of the problem. They work steadily to change their business practices and share what they’ve learned. But they recognize that this is not enough. They seek not only to do less harm, but more good.

Use business to protect nature
The challenges faced as a society require leadership. Once they identify a problem, they act. They embrace risk and act to protect and restore the stability, integrity and beauty of the web of life.

Not bound by convention
Their success—and much of the fun—lies in developing new ways to do things.","Apparel, Footwear & Accessories",Consumer Products & Services,Outdoor Apparel,United States,California,Ventura,Wholesale/Retail, 1000+,bcorporation.net/directory/patagonia-inc,2019,151.4,63.8,6.3,43.5,16.9,20.8,0.0,0.8,0.0,0,0.0,6.1,,16.3,4.3,,1.4,,,,,,,,,,10.0,25.4,1.7,,,,,3.7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,6.6,,,,,,,,,,6.6,,,0.0,,,,7.9,,1.1,,,,,6.4,,10.1,,,4.5,,3.0,,4.9,5.3,7.4,,,,,,,,,,1,5662,"One month ago, we closed our retail stores and distribution centers for the health and safety of our employees and customers.

Respect Group was incorporated on April 5th, 2004 by co-founders, Sheldon Kennedy and Wayne McNeil, to pursue their common passion: the prevention of bullying, abuse, harassment and discrimination (BAHD). Respect Group is made up of a team of 30 talented individuals whose passion is to create a global culture of Respect. We have enlisted pre-eminent experts to develop a best in class curriculum and e-learning platform. Expert content and a professional online certification model round out Respect Group's fully outsourced risk management behaviour-change solutions for sport, schools and the workplace. Wayne McNeil was Trustee and Vice-Chairman of the Rocky View School Division, volunteer President of the Sheldon Kennedy Foundation, which raised over $1.2 Million during the 1998 Cross-Canada Skate to raise awareness for the prevention of child abuse, served as Chairman of the Alberta Gymnastics Federation for six years and is a Board Member of the Sheldon Kennedy Child Advocacy Centre. These volunteer roles and his commitment to child advocacy lead Wayne to co-found Respect Group Inc.; Canada's first, on-line, abuse, discrimination, bullying and harassment prevention training program for community/sport organizations, schools and corporations. Wayne has a seasoned, professional background in Information Technology and Project Management that he developed through key global positions with Bell Canada, 3Com Corporation and Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC). This strong IT expertise enabled Wayne to create a solid team and technology approach for Respect Group. Wayne was instrumental in forging an exclusive partnership with the Canadian Red Cross to combine Canada's best abuse, bullying and harassment prevention curriculum (Respect Education) with Respect Group 's world-class, on-line training technology. In 2007, Wayne was awarded the Canadian Red Cross Caring Award for his leadership in the promotion of violence and abuse prevention education. Sheldon Kennedy won a Memorial Cup, World Junior Gold Medal and skated for three teams in his eight-year NHL career. He is best known for his courageous decision to charge his Major Junior Hockey league coach with sexual assault for the abuse he suffered over a five-year period while a teenager under his care. Through this disclosure, and the important work that Sheldon continues to do, he has become an inspiration to millions of abuse survivors around the world. Sheldon has been instrumental in bringing governments, public and private sector partners together to work collaboratively to influence policy change and improve the way child abuse is handled. He has influenced changes in Canadian law and has taken his message to the International Olympic Committee and the US Senate. Sheldon is the Lead Director at the Sheldon Kennedy Child Advocacy Centre, the first-of-its-kind in Canada, offering full wrap-around services for victims of child abuse. He is also the Co-Founder of Respect Group, which provides empowering online abuse, bullying and harassment prevention education to sport organizations, schools and the workplace. What Our Clients Have To Say We believe the benefits of a respectful workplace include improved team communication, enhanced organizational health, reduced absenteeism, and increased morale and productivity. Respect in the Workplace is helping us build a stronger, more vibrant campus culture, where every member feels valued for their contributions Obviously, super impressed with the program. Great to have it in such short bursts, and the app made it so convenient (I did most of it on my skytrain commute!). The messages are varied and made to be relevant to the parents, somehow in a way that empowers them to take action. I never felt like I was being talked down to. Even having done many similar trainings, I learned new things, and felt more confident to take action. It exceeded all my expectations, and quite honestly, it's in my top online education programs of all time. The Respect in School program provides the user the skills to recognize, identify and report suspected abuse, bullying and maltreatment. Countless students reported and disclosed past abuse and bullying during the implementation of the program and most sought counselling for the first time. The implementation of the Respect in School Program and sharing Sheldon Kennedy's journey of hope and healing has been one of the most powerful things I have done in my sixteen-year teaching career. June 19, 2018 For Immediate Release Today, the Honourable Kirsty Duncan, Minister of Science and Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities, announced stronger measures to eliminate harassment in the Canadian sport system. New provisions in funding agreements will support eligible sport organizations in fostering healthy and safe workplace environments. Effective immediately: ""Harassment of any kind is completely unacceptable, and the safety and security of athletes, coaches and officials is always our top priority. We all must play a role in protecting our young people and our athletes: to speak up when we see something that doesn't seem quite right and to listen—really listen—to our athletes. Offering certification programs for Community/Sport Organizations (Respect in Sport), Schools and the Workplace, Respect Group has certified over 1,000,000 Canadians. Quebec City, Quebec, June 12, 2018 – This morning, four of Bertrand Charest's 12 victims, Geneviève Simard, Anna Prchal, Gail Kelly and Émilie Cousineau, accompanied by JD Miller, B2ten president and co-founder, and Dominick Gauthier, B2ten co-founder and program director, attended the National Assembly of Quebec. On this occasion, the Minister of Education, Leisure and Sport (MELS) filed a motion to develop a government plan to prevent all forms of sexual, physical and psychological abuse in sport. Adopted unanimously in a spirit of non-partisanship, the motion calls for the MELS to implement an action plan by 2020. The 12 victims asked that the plan contain the following: ""This is an important day for the 12 victims, who have acted with determination to shine a spotlight on this significant problem in our society. The Government of Quebec has heard them and taken the necessary measures to prevent all forms of abuse in sport,"" said JD Miller. Your unanimous adoption of this motion sends a strong, clear message to the other provinces and territories, and to Ottawa."" ""I'm extremely proud that I've been able to help make a difference in protecting athletes, regardless of their sport. It wasn't easy to relive those moments, but knowing that regulations will be put in place to prevent abuse makes it worthwhile,"" said Geneviève Simard. With an action plan to prevent all forms of abuse, I would feel more comfortable letting my children join a sport federation one day,"" said Gail Kelly. We received truly incredible, comforting support. You can tell that this issue strikes a chord with Quebecers and Canadians. I know that going public was the right choice now that I see things moving in the right direction,"" said Anna Prchal. With a program in place, athletes will be better protected,"" said Émilie Cousineau. This was clearly demonstrated this morning. Canadian athletes speak out in Calgary to end abuse in sport Two victims of former Canadian National ski coach, Bertrand Charest, are calling for sweeping changes to end sexual abuse in sport and were in the city on Friday to share their stories with Calgarians. Former professional skiers Genevieve Simard and Amelie-Frederique Gagnon are among several women who were sexually assaulted by Charest.... The two women are advocating for a protection program that includes mandatory training for all coaches, volunteers, and everyone in the entourage of an athlete. We want to take this horrible chapter in our lives and we want to turn it into something positive and that's making sure these kinds of abuse never happen again and we need the government in helping us achieve that,"" said Simard.

In 2012, after retiring as CEO of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, I started researching how employers could address skyrocketing employer healthcare costs and make employees healthier and more productive. My conclusion: while employers can't fix our broken healthcare system, what they can control is building a workplace culture that not only improves employee health and wellbeing, but also substantially advances strategic business outcomes like the attraction and retention of highly qualified employees. My goal is to help employers embrace wellbeing strategies that deliver measurable returns and increase the number of businesses that practice workplace wellbeing as a top strategic priority.

Author of Get Slightly Famous: Become a Celebrity in Your Field and Attract More Business with Less Effort and co-author forthcoming book, Returns On Wellbeing (2021), with Jim Purcell.

Americans are increasingly unhealthy due to poor physical health and preventable chronic illness, mental and emotional challenges, and financial stress. Employers that address these problems through whole-person wellbeing can enjoy lower costs, higher profits, and competitive advantage—and do right by their employees. Physical Health: America is the unhealthiest of all industrialized nations. Over half of Americans have a chronic disease, 93 Million adults are obese, and over 100 Million are diabetic or pre-diabetic (CDC). Financial Wellbeing: 53% of US employees are suffering from stress due to their financial condition. 60% of US households have less than 3 months savings. 7 in 10 employees say employee finance is their top stressor. Mental Health: Depression is the top cause of disability and death in the world. Stress now affects 8 out of 10 US workers and 20% of US workers have a diagnosable mental illness. Substance abuse is epidemic. More productivity in the workplace is lost due to stress, depression, and substance abuse than to all other chronic illnesses combined. We bring together the thinking of authorities and experts in all aspects of employee wellbeing: from financing healthcare coverage to physical, mental, and financial health. Wellness Vs Wellbeing: Workplace wellness has focused on physical health with gym memberships, weight loss, and smoking cessation – which research shows has not worked. Our evidence-based approach to employee wellbeing uses culturally-based physical, mental, and financial health as the proven way to achieve ROI. Vendor Agnostic: Our wellness framework is grounded in research and takes a multi-disciplinary approach to human health. Our approach is not based on a single vendor or model and helps employers embrace a wellbeing framework based on thinking from experts on each key aspect of employee wellbeing. Holistic Approach: Unlike workplace ""wellness"" strategies that focus on physical fitness, we address the entire spectrum of employee health. We also consider wellbeing both in and outside the workplace. Our holistic approach addresses all fundamental aspects of human health.

We focus on teams that exhibit a history of making wise capital allocation decisions and are aligned with shareholders.

GOVERNANCE Good corporate governance ensures fair treatment of shareholders, customers and employees. In this realm, we look for diverse boards among the talent, race and gender spectrums.

The company has ranked in the Inc. 500/5000 roster of AmericaÕs fastest-growing companies for three consecutive years. Savvy RestÕs founder, Michael Penny, took an unusual path to business. He lived for 20 years in a yoga ashram, consuming little and owning less. After leaving that community, Penny worked in a mattress store and was struck by two realizations: 1) most people shop for mattresses in a state of tension and mistrust because of traditional selling practices, and 2) most conventional or foam mattresses contain toxic chemicals, particularly flame retardants and pesticides, that threaten both human and environmental health. 
 
 Penny viewed the bedroom as a key retreat from pollutant exposure, and better sleep as essential to health. In 2003, he opened his own mattress store and in 2006, founded Savvy Rest. Penny made a connection with a natural latex supplier from India, who extended him credit on the strength of a handshake and their shared outlook. Penny chose natural latex, organic wool, and organic cotton as materials for Savvy RestÕs signature mattress because they do not expose sleepers to off-gassing chemicals or pesticide residues.","Housewares, Home Furnishings, & Accessories",Consumer Products & Services,Mattresses,United States,Virginia,Charlottesville,Manufacturing, 10-49,bcorporation.net/directory/savvy-rest-inc,2017,80.1,19.9,0.0,23.6,15.1,21.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,3.6,,,,3.0,,0.9,,3.6,,,,,,8.9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,2.7,,2.6,,,,4.0,,,,12.5,,1.6,,3.3,,6.7,,,,,1.6,1.8,0.8,0.8,,,6.0,,1,5293,"Welcome, Savvy Rest Dealer.

Many consumers are aware that toxic chemicals in the home—including those in mattresses, bedding and furniture—are dangerous to health. Chemical flame retardants have been linked to cancer, obesity, infertility and developmental brain disorders. Along with other unsafe chemicals in synthetic foams and textiles, they off-gas into indoor air and degrade into easily-ingested dust particles. Exposure to these compounds has resulted in unprecedented levels in our bodies, with children carrying the highest load. Nontoxic, natural latex foam mattresses without flame retardants offer a luxurious, healthful alternative.

Less plastic means less landfill, more sustainable and environmentally conscious!--This delightful lipstick is not just for looks, it's an unbeatable lip balm and cheek tint. Rich in linoleic and oleic acids, this lip care can cure even the driest of lips. (Second-hand application by kissing encouraged!) The most common compliment I get about this product is the aroma: the rich and completely natural cocoa aroma is due to the high amount of pure cocoa butter used. This natural lip tint is creamy and silky-smooth. Each lip tint is lovingly colored with a mixture of edible mica and oxide (mineral makeup ingredients) and will give you a wonderful balance of color and moisture. Please keep in mind that since these are made without artificial pigments, the color will be a bit more subtle than your average drug store brand. However I find this to be a well-warranted and completely worthwhile trade off. Petroleum not only lacks any nutritional value for your skin, it can hinder your body's natural defenses and make your skin drier than it normally would be. My lip and cheek tint is currently available in Cappuccino, Magenta, Merlot, Pearl Rose, and Burgundy, however many more are currently being formulated. Now, I am not one to say a woman needs any makeup to be beautiful, that's why I have made my own mineral makeup for the last 3 years. All-Natural – No Phthalates – No Parabens – No Petroleum – No Synthetic Fragrances*This product has not been tested by the FDA and is not intended to cure any illness, however a lot of research and testing has been done to ensure you receive a well thought out and top-of the line product.

We provide consulting and learning experiences to the sector, providing the tools and expertise to accelerate and increase community impact. Stories are the universal language among humans. The good news is that social sector organizations have great stories to share – if you learn how to tell them in the right way. Social Impact Architects works with social sector organizations to develop succinct, compelling messages that convey your results and speak to your stakeholders' interests. We utilize a variety of tools to provide a holistic picture of the impact you have including anecdotes, internal/external data analysis, and social return on investment analysis. To achieve social impact, you have to start with the end in mind – uncover what you want to know and learn and it will lead you to measure the right things and analyze your social impact to support your decision-making. To do this, we start with the organization's logic model and work with you to define the impact you hope to achieve. We then work backwards to determine the tools you need to capture results and tell your organization's story in a compelling way. A good retreat has a focused agenda. A great retreat builds your team and facilitates discussion that takes your organization to the next level. Social Impact Architects will work alongside your team to build a customized agenda with expert facilitation before, during and after that will set the stage for results that matter – an engaged team, shared understanding, and manageable next steps.

A truly wise investment not only seeks profits, but also contributes to a far more sustainable, healthful world in the decades to come. That's where Social(k) comes in. Social(k) offers hundreds of investments using Environmental, Social, and Governance, (i.e. ESG screened investments) backed by a plethora of Financial research. Structured into traditional Mutual Funds, Social(k) helps you sleep at night knowing that you're pursuing the brightest possible future for your retirement and our planet. Learn about Investments in retirement plans Learn about Retirement Plans that hold investments The foundation of ESG screened investments 30 years ago, a group of institutional investment firms began adding Environmental, Social and or Governance, ESG, considerations, along with financial analysis, to their investment process. The MSCI KLD 400 Social Index, launched in 1990 is the longest measure of ESG investment results. This strategy has shown to aid in outperforming financial analysis alone. We now have multiple investment options that can layer Environmental, Social and Governance analysis on top of a traditional financial analysis. Social(k) pioneered bringing these investments to retirement plans. We work with our partner firms to bring a variety of retirement plan choices to your organization. Today more than ever before, employers and employees are interested in investments that help to bring positive change. This includes screening investments to avoid allocating money to companies backboned on risky or irresponsible policies which have shown to impede financial results. Two of Social(k)'s four website sections, Pricing, & Investments, address the costs of your plan and costs of the investments inside the plan. Pricing focuses on the administrative cost of a retirement plan itself. Investments cover the Mutual Funds or Exchange Traded Funds and the fees associated with those investments inside your plan. We pay special attention to ESG investing in retirement accounts overseen by ERISA (The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974). Individual retirement plans–IRA, SIMPLE IRA, SEP IRA, and Solo(k)–are usually one account per person. In group retirement plans–401(k) 403(b) or 457–multiple employees share a custodial account at a trust bank. When all participants are in one account, a Recordkeeper is used to track individual balances within the company pool. A Third Party Administrator (TPA) tracks and reports on plan specifics, following a Plan Document, approved by the Dept of Labor. In following these guidelines, the employer and employees gain tax advantages to encourage retirement saving. If you are building or altering a company plan, you should first determine the structure and type of plan that suits you, using our Choosing a Plan page. Once we've identified the type of plan, we'll walk through the options available from our Service Partners. Organizations come in many sizes and shapes, so it's important that we tailor a total retirement plan package that best suits your needs. We work directly with your firm or through your financial advisor to deliver an investment lineup with fiduciary oversight available. With the Accounts and Partners sections of this site, you'll find up-to-date information on all of Social(k)'s plans, with special attention paid to individual and group, ERISA accounts."

In spite of efforts by the California utilities and their allies to harm solar, Bay Area homeowners are going solar now more than ever. A custom designed and built solar photovoltaic (PV) system can buy you decades of energy at lower rates. If you are a developer, property manager or owner of a multi-family or affordable housing property, you can reduce the energy costs of your tenants and increase the value of your property with a custom designed and installed solar photovoltaic (PV) and/or solar thermal (hot water) system. When you are already operating on a tight budget, unpredictable electricity prices can pose a real threat to the future of your non-profit business. Operating a medical office, clinic, hospital, or health care campus in Northern California requires large amounts of reliable energy year-round. Solar photovoltaic (PV) and/or solar thermal (hot water) systems can reduce your energy bills, drastically improve your energy resiliency, lower your carbon footprint, and reinforce critical infrastructure in your community. Running a comfortable, clean, well-lit hotel can hit you hardest when the energy bill comes. When you invest in solar for your Bay Area hotel, you can cut energy costs for decades to come and show your customers that you are committed to a clean and sustainable future. Reduce electricity costs and show your Greater Bay Area customers that your business is dedicated to protecting the environment. Electricity can be one of the largest monthly expenses when you operate a large warehouse in the Bay Area. Founded in 1976, Sun Light & Power has been designing and building exceptional solar in the San Francisco Bay Area for 45 years. When it comes to combining solar energy with your business operation, think of solar as an investment that actually provides a return. A custom designed solar PV system or solar thermal hot water heating system will reduce your operating expenses, protect you from volatile utility costs, show your commitment to the environment and the green business movement, and can even increase the reliability of your electrical system.

There are many private treatment centres in Canada, but they believe their program is unique. While other programs focus on abstinence or reducing harm, they believe that the recovery process needs to move beyond mere healing. Instead, they help their clients experience personal transformation and full integration into society.",Healthcare Providers,Health & Human Services,Inpatient and outpatient addiction and mental health services,Canada,British Columbia,Powell River,Service with Significant Environmental Footprint, 10-49,bcorporation.net/directory/sunshine-coast-health-centre-2005-ltd,2017,117.2,27.4,28.7,17.6,13.5,29.8,0.0,0.0,2.8,0,1.1,6.4,,,,4.7,,5.5,,5.8,,,,,,4.8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.1,,2.3,,,,0.7,,,,,,4.5,,12.3,,6.5,,,,,2.2,2.3,1.1,2.2,,,1.7,,1,4042,"Private Drug Rehab and Alcohol Treatment At Sunshine Coast Health Centre we are committed to a client's personal transformation, the goal being healthy, thoughtful men who are inspired to live with a renewed sense of vitality and purpose. We recognize the importance of reconnecting with others in the recovery process and can help. We know that getting help is not an easy decision. That is why we're committed to giving you a sense of control every step of the way. We approach addiction as a response to a life that lacks meaning and purpose. While with us, we help you uncover your passion for living again. Recovering from addiction is more than being clean and sober. We're committed to your personal growth and helping you pursue the dreams you've set aside. We find many of our clients have turned to addiction in response to feeling separated or disconnected from others. This seems to hold true regardless of age, income, or drug of choice. As a result, we have intentionally designed our program to emphasize connection with others. For example, our clients benefit from the intimacy of an all-male peer group. Daily recreation and social events reinforce the importance of friendship. Family is emphasized through our complementary Family & Couples Program. Finally, our staff is valued as much (if not more) for their ability to relate to clients than their job skills. Throughout their stay with us, clients are encouraged to take control of their treatment plan. Clients have shown us that when we involve them in designing their treatment plan, they have a greater sense of ownership, not only in their plan, but in their long-term recovery. As a result, no two treatment plans at Sunshine Coast are the same because we recognize that no two clients are the same. Fortunately, staffing and programming are sufficiently flexible to allow clients multiple paths to recovery. Philosophically, our approach at Sunshine Coast emphasizes the capacities of clients to take control of their lives, regardless of circumstances or personal and social limitations. Clients learn that control is possible when they, as human beings, take existential responsibility for their situation, their suffering, and their destiny. This is wholly different than moral responsibility, or blame, which only leads to a sense of guilt for past wrongdoings and a reinforced sense of hopelessness. In other words, our version of responsibility means that clients are the author of their lives, able to ""rewrite"" their story and go forward with a sense of possibility for the future. It is important to recognize that most treatment centres resist the idea of giving clients control over their treatment. Sunshine Coast is decidedly non-12 Step in this respect, preferring that clients be free to solve their own problems rather than be directed by a counsellor acting as ""expert authority figure."" Ultimately, Sunshine Coast assumes that that clients are the best experts on themselves and, given the right conditions, can realize their potential. At Sunshine Coast, we recognize that clients must first have a reason to stop using drugs or alcohol. Without a reason, clients are likely to simply go through the motions, struggle with boredom and, eventually, relapse. Furthermore, Sunshine Coast recognizes that reasons that focus on fear are only effective in the short-term. Instead, our meaning-centered approach focuses on long-term aspirations such as intimate relatedness with friends and family and a fulfilling career. In other words, clients at Sunshine Coast explore recovery from the perspective of a life of possibility over avoidance. Once a client finds his purpose, we have noticed that the motivation to go to meetings, eat healthy and exercise regularly comes naturally. Sunshine Coast has designed a program that helps clients manage their lives more effectively. Like other programs, clients at Sunshine Coast learn to deal with immediate concerns (for example, alcohol cravings), environmental issues (for example, dealing with drug-using friends), and personal issues (anger, depression, and anxiety). Furthermore, our therapy provides avoidance strategies, such as techniques for decreasing anger or anxiety. We believe, however, that effective treatment is not just about coping, or even just healing, but also about growth. The staff at Sunshine Coast know that successful recovery is more than just a life free of problems. Instead, our program is designed to help clients overcome personal barriers that are keeping them from realizing their full potential. We offer on-site alcohol withdrawal and drug detox so our clients don't need to withdraw on their own. We treat everything from stimulants such as crack cocaine and painkillers such as Oxycontin. Whether for drug or alcohol detoxification, all clients start their treatment in our 24-hour staffed medical unit. We believe it is critical to involve families in the recovery process. That is why we offer a complimentary family & couples program. In addition, clinical staff provides ongoing support for family members while their loved one is in treatment even after they return home. In our experience, we find that loved ones who participate in these programs have a significant advantage over families who choose not to participate. By changing the family dynamic at home, all family members have a higher likelihood of healing and growth after clients return home from treatment. For more information, visit our Family & Couples Programs & Services page. We understand the destructive nature of drug addiction. In our drug rehab program, we use a non-12-step methodology of empowerment and work with you to create an individualized program that meets your needs. We partner with you in your recovery from drugs as soon as you register and provide ongoing support even after you return home. Mental health services are available in addition to addiction rehab. All clients receive initial medical and psychiatric assessments as well as ongoing medical and mental health services (psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, and masters level counsellors) during their stay. An Active Lifestyle is Key Getting fit and being active is a great way to start and maintain your recovery. We are committed to helping clients adopt a healthy lifestyle a key component to success. Our clients have access to onsite fitness and recreation services, including scheduled outings to local leisure areas. By working with our kinesiologist, clients can begin to develop the skills necessary to make health and wellness a part of their lifestyle back home. More Than Just Addiction Treatment Sunshine Coast Health Centre is not just for addiction treatment. We also treat mental health issues such as trauma, anxiety, and depression. Call us toll-free at  for more information on our trauma program. We are one of Canada's top alcohol treatment and drug rehabilitation centres. Located in Powell River, British Columbia, we are a mens-only, non 12-step rehab program serving Vancouver, Victoria, and all of British Columbia. At Sunshine Coast Health Centre, we welcome the opportunity to be different than other residential drug rehabilitation programs in Canada. Some of the innovations we have adopted since our opening in 2004 include: 1. A non-traditional treatment model approach that integrates non-12 Step, research-based practices, including medical, psychiatric, psychosocial, and positive existential psychotherapy. We are an abstinence-based program that is not based on the disease model of addiction. 2. A Focus Beyond Mere Abstinence focuses on personal transformation and full integration into society that goes beyond, yet includes, the traditional addiction treatment goals of abstinence as well as physical and mental stability. 3. An Emphasis on Client Strengths emphasizing the capacities of clients to take control of their lives, develop resilience, and find the courage to overcome fears. 4. An Emphasis on the 'Why' of Recovery while addressing (like most treatment centres) the 'how' of recovery meetings, a healthy diet, exercise, etc. Sunshine Coast also pays special attention to the 'why' of recovery. We believe that clients who are able to make sense of their lives will be more motivated to embrace a healthy lifestyle. An Environment Where Clients Can Be Themselves – allows clients to have an authentic relationship with their peer group and staff in an environment of empathy, genuineness, and unconditional, positive regard. Unlike most treatment centres, Sunshine Coast does not tell clients, directly or indirectly, what they can talk about or how to live their lives. 6. Therapy that is More About Process than Content – our therapists connect with clients at a human level which, we believe, is more important than any school or technique of psychotherapy. 7. A Shared Partnership with Families – encourages family members to set healthy boundaries and practice self-care. Family members examine their unhealthy responses to a loved one's addiction as unhelpful coping skills. Traditional characterizations of family members as 'co-dependent' and 'in denial' are avoided due to a lack of scientific validity. 8. Treatment for the Whole Person – recognizes the the full dimensions of each client biological, psychological, social and spiritual as opposed to merely generically treating an addict or his addiction. 9. Flexible Treatment Options recognizing that each client is unique, Sunshine Coast offers both private and semi-private rooms, varying lengths of stay (30,42, 60 and 90 days) as well as sober living for clients who require treatment that extends beyond 90 days. 10. An All-Male Peer Group clients connect with their peers a critical element of successful addiction treatment. Clients at Sunshine Coast report that an all-male peer group allows them to safely express difficult feelings and emotions and, ultimately, develop mutually supportive, enduring friendships.

Three Essential Elements for Evaluating Systems Initiatives You may be hearing terms like systems change, collective impact, and multi-sectoral initiatives a lot these days to describe situations where multiple actors are working together to tackle complex social problems. If you're working or considering working within one of these types of initiatives, it's critical to first recognize the complexity of the system (or set of interconnected parts) you're working with and to think about what success would look like within that system. Although systems are complex, systems thinking – and the corresponding evaluation design – can be broken down into three essential elements... The First Year of a New Presidency Moves Philanthropy to Action The speculation for most of us began on Wednesday morning, November 9, 2016. Regardless of political affiliation, the election win by a presidential candidate who promised dramatic changes in governing style and policies from the prior administration meant that grantmakers might have to rethink their current strategies and, quite possibly, fundamental priorities. As the new administration's policy agenda rolled out over its first year in office, the interest areas of more and more funders were touched by the shifting political landscape. For years, many in the nonprofit realm have advocated for increases in unrestricted funding, general operating support, and/or dedicated capacity building funds. But when it comes to reaping the full benefits of capacity building dollars, funding is not always enough. We believe that foundation capacity – like nonprofit capacity more broadly – is essential to impact.

Our distinctive methodology comes from our hands-on experience with the technology AND strategies utilized by today's successful nonprofits to build rewarding constituent relationships. When things go awry in complex technology projects, organizations can find themselves trapped between two difficult options. They can continue pushing forward with the initiative, potentially wasting resources on a project that is beyond hope of success, or they can abandon the initiative, undo existing work, and hope for funding to try again in the future. Both options carry risk of damaging support for the project and morale of the organization. If the issues in the project impact the organization's constituency, their reputation could also take a hit. (Read more about the costs of struggling projects here >>) It can be extremely stressful to figure out the best path forward when mired in issues and trying to carry out business-as-usual at the same time. Unfortunately, technology has not (yet) given us the ability to stop time while we get our operational houses in order, but it can help to reach out to an objective third party for help. Catherine enjoys enabling business transformation through human, technical and business process innovation. With over 15 years in the nonprofit sector, Catherine has experience setting strategic direction in technology, marketing and fundraising. Most recently, Catherine championed innovation within the Canadian Cancer Society at the national, provincial and local levels as a senior leader. She led change as a catalyst and by continually seeking and leveraging new and emerging technologies to facilitate deeper engagement with the Society's constituents while transforming business processes for efficiency. During a technology initiative, the signs of trouble are not always clear. Team members can be working their hardest to complete their tasks, but somehow the project milestones keep getting delayed or redefined. Rarely do staff want to pull the emergency brake on a project, openly calling attention to major concerns, even if they are frequently discussed in private and impacting costs. (Read about the costs of struggling projects here >>) This is why it's essential for leadership, managers, and staff to be aware of common warning phrases that can signal trouble is on the horizon for a project. Sandi has been working with nonprofit and higher education institutions for almost 20 years in a variety of roles. At Heller she has worked with hundreds of organizations– including schools, colleges, human service organizations, consulting on business process, building custom technical solutions, and developeding effective growth strategies. I know I'm not the only one who has multiple garlic presses in a drawer and have watched more than I'd like to admit of the infomercial for that twisty board thing that is supposed to tone your entire body. Luckily, those sorts of purchases don't really result in huge cost overruns or months of lost productivity. However, when we go to work, we tend to bring the same brains that buy gadgets and sometimes use them in large technology projects, but to disastrous results. We have a full staff retreat every year in January and it is always a really great time for us to connect as a team, review what worked in the past year and what we'd like to do differently this year, and take some time to share new ideas from the field. I am one of Heller's boomerang staff members (someone who left the company and returned at a later point), and they let me write the blog post this year to share my perspective on what our retreat looks like after having been gone a few years. Several people asked me through the week ""How does retreat compare to those from before you left?"" My answer: it was both pleasantly familiar and inspiring in whole new ways. The general feel of the retreat – the comradery amongst the team, the humor and productive-but-not-stuffy nature of the meetings – was very much the same. But the content of what we talked about was deeper and smarter and more focused than I think it ever has been. Every year more organizations are embracing the potential of advanced CRM systems and the wealth of data they generate. Business intelligence tools for nonprofits are designed to transform that valuable data into knowledge, helping organizations increase the impact of their missions. Expanding on the capability of applications designed for the commercial sector, nonprofits now have a variety of affordable options to unify disparate data silos and conduct genuine information analysis. I have always been passionate about the nonprofit sector and in finding solutions, making systems more efficient and manageable, and innovating to achieve an organization's goals. As a Salesforce.com Certified Administrator I have seen firsthand how Salesforce can drive success and efficiency in nonprofits and I want every organization to have the opportunity to effectively utilize the tools that are now available. The costs of struggling or failing projects are very real and can result in both short and long-term impact on an organization's ability to deliver its mission. This shouldn't come as a surprise–every initiative costs time and resources. However, less obvious costs that enter the equation as a complex implementation initiative starts to struggle do often come as a surprise and can really throw things off. As a project's risk of failure increases, it becomes difficult to establish a clear, objective viewpoint. It's common for teams to scramble for solutions as well as find someone to blame for the problems they are encountering. On November 16, Heller presented the seventh and final installment of our CRM Options for Enterprise Nonprofits webinar series designed to help organizations learn more about today's CRM solution marketplace. We also hope to help organizations understand and overcome common obstacles preventing them from adopting new technology. Below is the transcript of this installment focused on Revolution Online, a CRM built by ROI Solutions. At Dreamforce this year,The Chicago Council on Global Affairs' Database Services Officer Sara Darga presented with Keith Heller on how to strategically manage change during a technology project. Sara shared some of the tools and techniques that make up a comprehensive Change Management Success Framework and Keith outlined a few of the red flags that indicate a project might be in jeopardy. In this session they show how The Council's combination of an effective change management plan and real-time monitoring was instrumental in helping them achieve extremely high user adoption of their system, allowing them to provide a more effective forum for world leaders, policymakers, and other experts to speak on global issues. It's nearing the end of the year, and many nonprofits are their busiest during this quarter. With all of the year-end campaigns, fundraising activities, and general calendar-year close going on, it can be a time when an organization can feel at capacity. To make sure that no one burns out, organizations plan carefully to make sure that every task is assigned appropriately and that all that hard work is rewarded with bowls of chocolates or even a morning celebration when the year-end fundraising goal gets surpassed. If you've been keeping score at home you may remember our frenzy of Salesforce certifications from Dreamforce 2016. Val was member of that Exceptional Eight earning her Platform Developer I certification. Clearly, she didn't think that was enough, and has been working hard this year for a few more.

thanksgivingcoffee.com,001C000001N5Q07IAF,Thanksgiving Coffee Co.,2015-11-04,2019-03-28,certified,"Thanksgiving Coffee Company began roasting coffee in 1972 in an old wooden fish-packing plant, nestled in the Noyo Harbor of Northern California. Much like a scene from SteinbeckÕs Cannery Row, rugged fishermen, artisan boat builders, cranky deck hands, and the salty aroma of a working harbor surrounded them.
 
 Their approach to coffee roasting was inspired by the bountiful landscape and a proud culture of craftsmanship. The salmon catches decreased each year and the redwood trees were logged faster than they could grow, forcing the local mill to close. Many craftspeople disappeared too, leaving unemployment and a struggling community.
 
 Thanksgiving Coffee grew up in the midst of a once vibrant, resource-rich environment. They learned about sustainability by watching the foundations of their local economy disappear. Their business model is informed by their experience; a light footprint on the planet and a heavy focus on economic justice was their response. Every pound of coffee they roast, and every cup that is brewed, celebrates the craftsmanship of family farmers and provides stability and hope Ð in Mendocino County and in communities around the world.",Food & Beverage,Consumer Products & Services,Artisan Coffee Roaster,United States,California,Fort Bragg,Agriculture/Growers, 10-49,bcorporation.net/directory/thanksgiving-coffee-co,2017,103.7,38.0,0.0,27.6,16.4,21.5,0.0,0.0,2.2,0,1.0,5.7,,,,4.1,,3.0,,4.7,,,,,,10.0,,10.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,,1.1,0.9,,,4.4,,,,11.1,,3.8,,5.7,,5.9,,,,,1.3,2.2,1.1,0.4,,,3.5,,1,5327,We are an artisan coffee roaster in Northern California.

First Nations people were forced throughout the United States' expansion to enter into treaties ceding some territories while retaining others. Every one of those treaties were broken by the US government, and the result is the current reservation system, with many First Nations people retaining only a tiny percentage of their traditional territories and other First Nations forcibly relocated onto lands with which they held no connection or left without any lands to call their own. A traditional territory is the geographic area identified by a First Nation as the land they and/or their ancestors traditionally occupied and used. This land matters, and the people who tended to the land for centuries matter. We acknowledge that we live on this stolen land as uninvited visitors. We honour indigenous people and this land by using our business as a medium to raise awareness, speak our truths, feel the unbearable injustice that was done to First Nations people, create communities based on deep values of respect and generosity, protect the wisdom of elders, hire indigenous people, build bridges, promote indigenous entrepreneurs and their businesses and do our own inner work to understand and acknowledge who we represent. We choose who we are beyond what we represent by our looks so we can build bridges toward a world for and by us all, in community for the next 7 generations. This campaign is the ONE to support ALL, sponsored by radically generous companies and other people who want our world to be an accessible one and use their money as nutrients to grow an equal access community. The Alinker is a non-motorized walking-bike without pedals. With an adjustable saddle and handlebars, it is custom designed to challenge society's assumptions about disability. Most medical devices are a technical solution for a body with a problem, it emphasizes the ""problem"". But, we are humans, and we have a body. The body does not determine who we are. So the Alinker is designed for how we want to live, regardless of mobility challenges. The Alinker is for people who identify with being an active person (who they are), but happen to have an illness or condition that impacts their mobility (what they have). It is for people who want to maintain an active life and support their wellness practices. From intense engagement with our customers, we know that the Alinker is used by people with Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Cerebral Palsy, Spinal Cord Injuries, Muscular Dystrophy (including CMT), Arthritis, (Pre)-Diabetes, Neuropathy, as well as people going through stroke recovery, or post-surgery rehabilitation, amputees and so on. Other than the physical state, having a mindset dedicated to health and wellness has proven to be a crucial factor for successfully using the Alinker. Based on our experience, we can generally say that you need to be at least able to do the following: Be prepared to spend some time to get used to the new way of moving, it addresses muscle groups you might not have used for a while, and building your condition is to be done gradually. Showing commitment to maintaining healthy practice and knowing that it will be worth the effort this is what investing in your wellness can look like. Many people who break their back / neck, or get diagnosed with MS, etc, hear from their doctors that they should get used to the idea of using a wheelchair, that they will not walk again. We are discovering that the Alinker activates the brain circuitry and with practice, more is possible. Our urban landscapes are changing and the Alinker is an excellent 'last-mile' vehicle, making an inner-city a more inclusive environment, where people with a variety of abilities are using the same vehicle. When measuring your inseam, measure lightly. When the measurement is on the cusp, choose the smaller size. From time to time, people find that the Alinker isn't for them and send it back, using the 30-day return policy we offer. Sometimes people order the wrong size and we exchange it for another size. These 'gently used' Alinkers might come with minor cosmetic damages, like scratches on the body of the Alinker or a nick out of the foam handlebar. However, they undergo strict quality controls to make sure they have only sustained minor cosmetic damages and no structural damages. Limited numbers available now, and they sell at a first come first serve basis. It's like that saying: If you don't use it, you lose it"" ""The Coolest Trike Ever Designed Makes Mobility More Social, Too"" ""The walking bike called the Alinker is changing lives for who wants to stay active, regardless of mobility challenges"" ""You're perceived completely differently.

Anna O, active Alinker user I feel secure when riding the Alinker. Before the Alinker, I was in a grey time... I had pretty much given up on moving like a normal human being again. Now, I can go for a walk, go out with the dog again, get out in the neighbourhood some people I hadn't seen in 3 years. Chris K, active Alinker user Since I've had the Alinker, my autonomous world is bigger. I can be independent moving around spaces like leaving my house, airports, train stations, even museums... I am not relying on someone else to move me around anymore. But now that I have the Alinker, I can walk, talk, and laugh at the same time.

Often it feels like the minute 3:45 hits on the clock my daily studio practice is hijacked by meeting kids needs, homework, dinner prep and often chaos. When possible I prefer to work through the homework-dinner prep rush and your slow cook recipes allow me to do just that. We are early risers in my house and for me I would much rather prep dinner in the early mornings when the kitchen is already uprooted with breakfast and then not have to think about much other than a salad and veg. until 5. Evanston, Illinois the zen of slow cooking Spices are a huge help in my cooking. I am a gluten free vegan which can make meals difficult sometimes. Their spices add the perfect addition to my dishes. My favorite spice pack is the Indian dal spice packet. It does not have that bitter taste like other turmeric and curry spices. I make the curried lentils (using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth) a couple of times a month. It is my go to meal to bring to dinner parties or to bring to someone who is ill or recovering from a surgery. Its also a great addition to tofu scramble or lentil soup. These spices also make great gifts at all times but especially during the Holidays. My father became a widower when my mother passed away in 2012. Having had a long, loving, and traditional marriage for 55 years, he was at loose ends in the kitchen. My mother had been the only meal planner, shopper, and chef...although he does dry a mean dish. Living in a retirement community, he has plenty of meal options, but all of them are determined by strangers and prepared by a distant staff. It's a wonderful luxury, but I came to realize that what he gained in convenience, he gave up in enjoyment. There's nothing like looking forward to a meal prepared just to your liking. Then I met Jane, and Meg, and found an entire world of recipes that he could create himself, safely, in his own kitchen and on his own timetable. They are easy to modify to allow for fewer servings, they offer familiar ingredients but surprisingly modern tastes, and best of all, he can enjoy the sights and smells of dinner cooking while he goes about his day. At Christmas last year, I made him a cookbook of a dozen or so recipes from the Zen of Slow Cooking website. He started with the simplest one, and surprised even himself with how easy it was to assemble, but most of all, how delicious and elegant the end result was. As new recipes are posted, I'll email him ones I think he would like to try. He has taken to inviting neighbors over every now and then for dinner, and takes pride and satisfaction in having expanded his skill set. For me, I am beyond grateful for the way that slow cooking, and Zen's recipes, has given my father a new kind of self-sufficiency and independence. He has the ability to provide for himself in the most elemental of ways, and that is a priceless gift. Social bringing a little zen into your kitchen © 2017. Launch theme by Pixel Union.

When the season ends, we are fortunate to live in a city that has a centrally located food terminal where we can obtain good quality ingredients to keep producing our food, close to home, all year round. Our story started in 2010; inspired by the Mumbai dabawallas, we investigated reducing lunchtime packaging waste by creating a ""litter-less"" lunch delivery service in Toronto. With a simple menu, prepared fresh each morning at Udupi Palace (the restaurant we work out of), we packaged the items in reusable stainless steel tiffins and started delivering them to offices in downtown Toronto. Within a few months, this lunch delivery service became really popular and it allowed us to market test recipes for products we could bring to retail. Our retail line of ready-to-eat curry stews launched in 2014. Each one contains a plant-based protein from lentils and pulses. We scaled these recipes specifically so people could select plant-based proteins often without compromising on taste and nutrition. As their popularity grew, we transitioned out of the tiffin lunch deliveries. Today, our products are available throughout Ontario at independently owned food stores. Tiffinday is a certified B-Corporation. We have pledged to conduct our business with respect to people and the environment and be the change we seek in the world. What you eat matters.

Don't forget to cut back on plastic waste by packing your wraps in eco-friendly reusable containers, totes and insulated food jars. Fill a large skillet halfway with water and heat until warm. Remove from heat and place rice paper into water for about 20 seconds, or until soft. Lay wrapper on a paper towel to absorb excess moisture, then transfer to a cutting board. On the bottom half of the rice paper (the side closest to you), spread the cabbage and carrots in one layer. Top with cucumber, avocado, and cilantro leaves. Carefully fold the bottom of the rice paper wrapper over the vegetables. Fold in the sides and continue rolling up from the bottom, keeping the rice paper tight. Serve immediately, with almond butter sauce on the side. Add all ingredients to a bowl and mix until well combined. This post has been modified, by permission, from Thrive Market. Recipes by Angela Gaines. There is Now a Ton of Plastic Trash for Every Person on Earth A new study released data on all the plastics ever made, and the findings are alarming. More than 8.3 billion tons of plastic have been produced since 1950 and over half the plastic ever produced was made in the past 13 years. We have heard some pretty staggering facts related to single-use waste, and they're so overwhelming that we've become desensitized in a way. But this one is hard to comprehend: There is now one ton of plastic garbage for every person on Earth. A study by ScienceAdvances released in July gathered global data on the lifecycle of plastic. They studied data on the production, use, and end-of-life management of plastic components for the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever manufactured. The study estimates that of the 8,300 million metric tons of plastics have been produced and about 6,300 million metric tons has reached the end of its useful life and is now considered trash. Shockingly, only 9% of it has been recycled, 12% was incinerated, and 79% polluted landfills or the environment. If the trend continues, about 12,000 million tons of plastic waste will be in landfills or in the environment by 2050. The study also found that plastic production is rapidly accelerating and single-use plastic packaging is now the largest plastic market. The world has made as much plastic in the past 13 years it did in the previous 50. Immerse yourself in plastic pollution news. Connect with people and organizations advocating for reducing plastic waste like Break Free From Plastic. Take the pledge to reduce single-use plastic at Plastic Pollution Coalition: REFUSE disposable plastic whenever and wherever possible. Choose items that are not packaged in plastic, and carry your own bags, containers and utensils. REUSE durable, non-toxic straws, utensils, to-go containers, bottles, bags, and other everyday items. Choose glass, paper, stainless steel, wood, ceramic and bamboo over plastic. REDUCE your plastic footprint. Cut down on your consumption of goods that contain excessive plastic packaging and parts. If it will leave behind plastic trash, don't buy it. RECYCLE what you can't refuse, reduce or reuse. Pay attention to the entire life cycle of items you bring into your life, from source to manufacturing to distribution to disposal. Get serious about being part of the movement to eliminate single-use plastic. Image credit: Justin Hofman.

Make the quinoa: Follow package instructions, adding the miso to the pot when cooking. Cool quinoa completely before wrapping. Make the filling: In a small bowl, add salmon, mayonnaise, toasted sesame oil, and wasabi. Mix with a fork, then set aside with the other veggies.

Place half of the salmon mixture, beets, arugula, and yellow bell pepper over the quinoa; roll from the bottom up. Repeat with remaining wrap. Eat immediately, or refrigerate for up to 2 days. Tamsin Stringer is a senior at Bloomington High School South and was named Project Green Challenge 2016 Champion. She was born in the UK, spent her early childhood in Japan, and has now lived for ten years in Indiana. At school, she is a student leader for the club Students Advocating for a Greener Environment (SAGE). Turning Green's Project Green Challenge gave me the chance to create positive change in my school, community and life. It gave me the confidence to step up for things bigger than myself and the opportunity to connect with people from all over the world. Before October 2016, like many people my age, I had fallen into a conventional lifestyle. While I was part of an environmental group in my high school and participated in student initiatives to better our community, I didn't actually know what it meant to live sustainably. I was being pulled into a world of consumerism and waste that I didn't even know existed, and I didn't think my daily choices had much of an impact. But after participating in more than 90 of the PGC challenges – advocating through art, interviewing local farmers, co-leading a school recycling effort – I began to have a different perspective on the world. PGC taught me about the importance of fair trade, the significance of renewable energy sources, and the benefits of a sustainable food system. The challenges me forced me to come out of my comfort zone and advocate for the environment by taking real action. I wrote to my senators to support the legalization of industrial hemp, I spread awareness about the horrific labor conditions that make fast fashion possible, and so much more. Eventually, I completely changed my lifestyle habits. I started to minimize personal waste and made efforts to become zero waste with U Konserve's fantastic lunch containers, glass water bottles, and reusable sandwich baggies. I started eating FLOSN (Fresh, Local, Organic, Seasonal, Non-GMO), and I made an effort to start buying products from more ethical companies – healthy hygiene products from Acure and Everyone, and organic food products from Amy's and Clif Bar. However, what really surprised me was the fact that with every new challenge, people around me were also affected. I wasn't sure how my friends and teachers would react, but the ripple effects of each challenge were amazing. Everyone was so supportive, and several people I knew started making changes in their own lives as a result of what I was doing. Some pledged to stop buying fast fashion, some started drinking from reusable water bottles, and others became more conscious about sustainable food choices. The PGC Finals, held in the beautiful rolling hills of Marin County, were some of the most inspiring days of my life. It was so motivating to be able to meet not only the peers I had engaged with online, but also the community leaders and company executives who took part in the eco-summit. Learning from these incredible people as they shared their diverse life and work experiences was such a privilege. Since the PGC Finals, I have been ever-more inspired to create lasting change in my local community. I have continued my Green Resolutions project which involves individuals making pledges to live more sustainably, and I have been working with an elementary school teacher to raise awareness about environmental issues in younger children. One result of this last project was that the school decided to abandon the use of disposable styrofoam trays in the cafeteria, in favor of reusable trays. A realization that I had after participating in PGC is that people have to come together to create change. Even though this program was a competition, it consistently spread the message of community and togetherness, which has inspired me to become more conscious of the world I live in from a local and global perspective. I feel like this kind of collective consciousness is even more important in the current political climate which sometimes seems to encourage extreme individualism and divisiveness. I believe that any young person would benefit tremendously from taking part in Project Green Challenge. The journey itself is amazing, whether or not a participant makes it to the finals. Though it may seem like a lot of work and some late nights, I feel that every effort I put in was worth it, and it made me become a better person. Thanks to PGC, I have become an advocate for the environment and will continue to create positive change in our world as I take on new challenges in the future.

We're so grateful for Jack Johnson's dedication to eliminate single-use plastic, and honored to have been included at the Plastic Pollution Coalition table at his concerts in Berkeley and Los Angeles, among friends and partners working together to offer alternatives to disposable plastic. His recent tour supports local and national non-profits educating the public about our plastic pollution crisis. At the concerts, fans can speak with the different groups, see examples of plastic-free solutions, and take environmental action. Smog of the Sea Film Jack Johnson is also raising awareness in the new film Smog of the Sea where he, 5 Gyres founder Marcus Eriksen, and other citizen scientists assessed plastic pollution on a week-long journey through remote waters in the North Atlantic. They took water samples they captured using a trawl and began to sift through the debris and separate the plastics from the sea water and plant matter. The results were stunning. They found that the term ""garbage patch"" is a myth: the waters stretching to the horizon were clear blue, with no islands of trash in sight. But as the crew surveyed the water and sorted through their haul, a more disturbing reality set in: a fog of microplastics permeates the world's oceans, trillions of nearly invisible plastic pieces making their way up the marine food chain. Watch the trailer here. Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation and Kokua Hawaii Foundation Jack Johnson also created the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation, a non-profit public charity supporting environmental, art and music education worldwide. In addition to funding environmental initiatives, the Foundation builds relationships with grantees offering music and arts education for youth, primarily in Hawaii and California. Music grants are given to support school or community-based music programs, and art grants support a variety of visual and performing arts programs. Most recently, the foundation has supported environmental art projects that integrate sustainable local food and plastic-free initiatives. Also founded by Johnson, the Kokua Hawaii Foundation is a non-profit organization that supports environmental education in schools and communities in Hawaii. Their mission is to provide students with experiences that will enhance their appreciation for and understanding of their environment so they will be lifelong stewards of the earth. While you're soaking up some much-needed summer rays, the back-to-school season is right around the corner. We recognize how important it is to start off the school year feeling totally equipped to take on the world. But the sad reality is that so many popular back-to-school products aren't doing you – or the planet – any good. In fact, the vast majority of conventional items are laden with harmful ingredients, swathed in layers of wasteful packaging, and produced using unfair labor practices. The National Retail Federation predicts that this year's back-to-school shopping will spike ten percent from last year, totaling a whopping $83.6 billion in spending. And most of those products are taking a significant social and environmental toll. Even with the best of intentions, it can be difficult to distinguish between conventional and conscious brands. Enter Green Thursdays – Turning Green's brand new back-to-school initiative, designed to help you put your dollars toward eco-friendly products with a positive impact. For your purchasing pleasure, we have curated a checklist of some of our favorite conscious brands in the following ten categories: 1. Body: Everything you put directly on your body, including shower gel, deodorant, toothpaste and more. Have you ever checked out the ingredients labels in your ""go-to"" products? 2. Clean: Most cleaning products contain VOCs (volatile organic compounds, such as ammonia), which contribute to indoor and outdoor air pollution. Not the case with our preferred brands! 3. Home: From desk lamps to houseplants, our list will help you make your living space as green as can be. 4. Study: Hit the books with 100% post-consumer recycled notebooks, eco-friendly backpacks, and tech galore. 5. Eat/Drink: Our list of FLOSN (fresh, local, organic, seasonal, non-GMO) snacks, beverages and meals makes it easier than ever to nourish the body and mind. 6. Bathe: Ethically made towels, toilet paper and shower shoes will help green your morning and evening routines. 7. Active: Healthy body, healthy mind. Gear up with some of the greenest brands in the business, featuring activewear, yoga mats and more. 8. Sleep: Cotton is one of the most pesticide-laden crops on the planet. You'll sleep well knowing your sheets, pillowcases and PJs are 100% organic cotton. 9. Zero Waste: Reusable water bottles, food containers and utensils make it easy to eat on the go without creating waste. 10. Wellness: Maintaining your wellness is the key to crushing it at school. Herbal supplements, natural pain relievers, and essential oils will help you feel your best all year round. As you curate your living space this year, we encourage you to buy less and shop smart while using Turning Green's new Back-to-School Checklist as a guide. You can assess your personal footprint and take practical steps to reduce it. Look for labels like USDA Certified Organic, Non-GMO Verified, Fair Trade, and 100% post-consumer recycled, as well as items that are second hand, recycled and upcycled. If you have to buy new products, consider our checklist your comprehensive guide to supporting businesses and companies that are doing right by people and planet. Choosing these products over conventional brands means voting with your dollar. It means carving out a bigger piece of that $83.6 billion pie for conscious goods. It makes a statement that you care as much about what you're putting in, on and around your body as you do about how those products impact your community, and the earth as a whole.

To keep everyone happy we like to get creative and pack an assortment of healthy road trip snacks. When we're prepared with homemade real food snacks, we tend to avoid the overly processed stuff available along the road (and everyone feels better). 1. Wellness Energy Bars from The Wellness Mama 2. Roasted Chickpeas from Stuffed Suitcase 3. Peanut Granola Bars from The Healthy Maven 4. No Bake Energy Bites from Cooking Classy 5. Baked Oatmeal Fruit Cups from The Wholesome Dish 6.

Everyone looks forward to summer vacation: school is out, work slows down and it's the best time to plan a few trips with your family. Whether they are short trips for a weekend away, or a long flight across the country, traveling with kids is a challenge, so here are some tips to help you prepare for your next summer outing. With the pull of social media, it's nice to find something to do in the car so that kids spend time looking out the window instead of staring at a screen. Downloading audio podcasts is a favorite of ours for long road trips. Look at Common Sense Media for age-appropriate recommendations. Find a biography, a book-on-tape (like the Penderwicks, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle or James and the Giant Peach), or choose from the seemingly endless list of riveting TedTalks (about everything from Bees to Creativity), and time will fly by. Many schools have a summer reading list, so road trips and flights are the best time to get going on reading homework. If books aren't holding your child's attention, try checking out magazines from the library. Little kids will love Ladybug and Spider, and our all-time favorite is Stone Soup. Also try books with riddles or poems like Where the Sidewalk Ends by Shel Silverstein or science books like Exploratopia by San Francisco's Exploratorium. Any version of Taboo is a great road trip game, and even the drivers can play without taking their eyes off the road. Similar to Password, one person tries to get everyone else to say a word by saying anything except the ""taboo"" words listed on their card. It's tricky and encourages some creativity. And, there's always the old-fashioned license plate game that can keep kids busy for hours. Everyone in the car keeps a list of all the states they can find represented by license plates on passing cars. It's easy to change the game depending on the ages of the kids: after older children find a state, they can name the states that border it, or name the state's capital. Also try homemade travel board games like travel tic-tac-toe or a marble maze. You could also pass the time by sewing your course on a map, then you can keep the map later as a souvenir. Of course traveling with kids is never easy without snacks to help perk up weary minds and pass the time. Pack more than you think you'll need, and include a variety of healthy snacks, dips and treats. Try these energy bar and bite recipes, full of protein, easy to make (many are no-bake) and store, and low in sugar. Cut fruit or a selection of veggies and dips are also great road-trip snacks. For a longer trip, try these healthy lunch ideas. Pack your snacks in easy-to-clean, leak-resistant stainless steel containers. Don't forget to bring water in glass water bottles. It will also be handy to have your reusable bottles and containers at your destination for family outings. To ensure that our planet remains healthy for future generations, it's our responsibility to teach kids how to be eco-conscious. According to the EPA, Americans generate about 254 million tons of trash every year. That breaks down to 4.4 pounds of trash per person per day. And, we're only recycling and composting about 1.5 pounds of that waste. Each bag of trash we roll out to the curb has to be collected, then taken to a landfill where it's either buried or burned. Unfortunately, neither burning trash nor burying it is good for the planet. According to National Geographic's story Human Footprint: Where Does All the Stuff Go? burning trash releases gasses into the air, contributing to dangerous smog. Burying trash in landfills simply covers it up, and because the trash isn't exposed to air and water, it fails to break down and instead releases toxins into our air, soil and groundwater. Trash is just part of our environmental problem. Our carbon footprint also includes the cars we drive, the electricity we use, the water we waste and the food we buy. Almost every action we take somehow impacts our planet. The good news is that we can lower our impact with a few easy changes, and we can teach our children to be mindful of their everyday behaviors to decrease their carbon footprint as well. Don't waste unnecessary electricity. Even very young kids can be mindful of their electricity usage and should turn off lights and other electronics when not in use. Another great way to help younger kids participate is to help them remember to turn off the faucet when they are soaping up their hands or brushing their teeth. According to the NRDC, ""40 percent of food in the United States today goes uneaten. This not only means that Americans are throwing out the equivalent of $165 billion each year, but also that the uneaten food ends up rotting in landfills as the single largest component of U.S. municipal solid waste where it accounts for a large portion of U.S. methane emissions."" Don't toss out food. Begin a family compost effort so that food can be used to help the Earth, not linger in landfills. Organic produce gardens, flower gardens or shrubs and trees all help the planet. Every bit of green adds more oxygen and eliminates carbon dioxide from the environment. Leave the car at home Driving creates pollution. Bike or walk with kids when you're able. Encourage them to embrace more natural, eco-friendly forms of transportation. Donate clothes, shoes and toys It's best to buy fewer clothes, and try shopping at consignment and vintage shops. If you do have items that you don't need, don't toss them in the trash. Instead, donate used items to a local charity or thrift store. Your older items may be someone else's treasure. Red meat and carbon dioxide go hand-in-hand. Trash and litter pollutes our planet. Teach kids to not be a ""litter bug"" and encourage them to pick up trash when they see it lying around in parks, beaches or other areas. Saving the environment means reusing items when possible. Buy books and other items at thrift stores and donate them back. Use reusable water bottles and lunch containers so your kids limit single-use plastic and learn that everyday actions can have a huge impact. Even though recycling is not the answer to our waste problem, it is important to do if you have items that can be recycled. Glass, paper and aluminum can usually be easily and efficiently recycled. Check with your local waste-management service to find out which plastic products can be recycling in your county. This is a guest post, with edits, from Uma Campbell."

Our Keynote addresses transcends motivation and inspires the reinvention of your practices, your communication, and your leadership. Being a Leader is an experience that forces you to discover the restraints you have created upon yourself, unshackling your potential. If you do the work, Being a Leader will allow you to create new possibilities for yourself, your family, your organization and your community. In traditional education you hope to apply what was taught and sharpen the saw. Being a Leader challenges you to take your new potential and apply it to a project to gain immediate results, results which were not even in your world of possibility prior. That is the gift of Being a Leader, the opportunity to rise to a new level of possibility and create a real world impact during and ongoing after the course. In organizational leadership I am active in five organizations as either a board chair, shareholder or operating executive. Believing in the methodology and impact of being a leader, over 50 individuals across the organizations I am involved with have been engaged with the course, coaching or course materials. What I have witnessed in the organizations that embraced the new level of integrity that being a leader creates is outstanding results. Specifically in 2019, two for profit organizations increased their EBIT year over year by 92% and 72% respectfully. A NGO ran a 5% operating surplus while adding in cost of increased employee benefits, retirement funding, staffing merit increases and 15% lower employee churn than industry averages. These results could have occurred in prior years as the management systems and techniques were in place and did not change for 2019, but due to Being A Leader those systems had a new level of integrity, accountability and possibility that allowed the results to occur. Pick a project, create new possibilities and become a new leader. Our session...created a new kind of dialog and understanding within our team. We've done other team-building exercises but this was the first to establish long term change... ... we are extremely happy to have experienced this and are on our way to achieving our goals. The Course has awakened my ""true spirit"" and re-connected [me] to who I am as a leader and to express my leadership as nature intended it to be. For example – We Dene – knew who we were at one time. With this course, we have a chance to be that Dene again and live with the historical impacts and create a future of integrity. This course has given me tools to continue the journey of humanity and leadership – To make a difference by taking a stand to influence the world – my world – to pass on this knowledge. I recommend this... to anyone ready to find the root causes holding them back in life or work, to dig deep and address why, then develop a practical plan to move forward and make it happen.. ...opening up conversations that were trapped in a deadened cycle on a repeated loop. In just two days my thinking got turned upside-down and sideways creating an outlet that resulted in opening up conversations that were trapped in a deadened cycle on a repeated loop. The insight for me was the recognition that the ""thinking ""which precedes conversations can either contribute to its success or its failure depending on whether you want the same results or have successful, meaningful conversations.

Money bail is the gateway to mass incarceration and the prisons of poverty. Our model is a pre-paid way for people to reclaim more control over their lives. Vonzella works to protect innocence and safety in a time of overpolicing and inequity. If you can't make bail, you're held in jail until trial. You can lose your job, housing, custody and worse. This affects generations and cements inequities. Pre-trial jail alone also directly costs taxpayers $170 billion each year. Covering bail amounts $78-5,000 through Cost-Sharing. We focus on minor offenses and misdemeanors, often called ""the crimes of being poor,"" ""crimes of being black,"" or ""crimes of being brown."" The fact is, people of color and low-to-moderate income individuals often face more policing and stiffer penalties for these offenses. They also create spiraling effects of fines and fees that can't be paid. Bail bonds often serve higher bail fees, leaving lesser alleged crimes unserved. In Hennepin County, pre-jail terms are almost a month. ALL WHILE BEFORE BEING FOUND GUILTY. Bail bonds and even bail funds are reactive, stressful and unpredictable. Our transparent, pre-paid model creates a pro-active solution within the communities. Even bail funds have barriers to disseminating bail. Our pro-active, pre-paid plan puts control in the hands of the people who use it. One call pushes notifications and begins the transfer of funds. Those who are overpoliced are often unbanked. We are creating a new system to create and make collective wealth visible, affordable and achievable. In the long-term, this can restore resiliency to vulnerable communities. When one person is arrested, many are affected. Each user can have advocates alerted upon arrest. Advocates can also pay into one person's coverage. We are creating a low-barrier solution that is easy to use in the stress, chaos and unpredictability of an arrest. Relying on widely available technology and affordable premiums, we want those who need Vonzella to be able to use it. A WORD FROM THE FOUNDER ""We focus on the under-banked and over-policed.

It is great for a quick mid-week meal, and as with all of our seafood, each package will be labelled with the boat and fisherman of origin for full traceability! 1lb packs, 2 fillets per pack. Plus, it is perfect for leftover ham sandwiches! ~4-8 lbs. Ingredients: Walden Pork, brown sugar, sea salt, celery powder, Vermont maple syrup. The perfect morning sausage and one of our most popular! 1lb packs. Ingredients: Walden pork, Vermont maple syrup, Vermont maple sugar, salt, spice extractives (sage, black pepper, ginger). Made in Shelburne, VT. A perennial favorite, our sea scallops are caught off the coast of MA and are immediately flash frozen to maintain top quality. They are also 'dry', meaning no extra water has been added to extend freshness. This results in a meatier, sweeter scallop that loses less water during cooking. Check it out for yourself! 1lb packs, ~12 scallops per pack."

Wallaroo prides itself on being a leader in the fashion-forward, sun protective hat industry, combining the latest fabrics and designs with maximum sun protection. Many of the hats in the Wallaroo Collection are rated UPF 50+ ensuring that the customer gets a 97.5% UV block from the sun's harmful rays. With the incidence of skin cancer on the rise nationally, sun protection is more important now than ever before. Wallaroo is actively involved with the Skin Cancer Foundation and many Wallaroo hats are recommended as an effective UV protectant.

Additionally, over the last 19 years, Wallaroo has made both financial and product donations to organizations such as the Melanoma Research Foundation, The Skin Cancer Research Foundation, The Colorado Melanoma Foundation and also participated in various events including Mallets for Melanoma, Miles for Melanoma among others.","Apparel, Footwear & Accessories",Consumer Products & Services,UPF 50+ fabric hats,United States,Colorado,Boulder,Wholesale/Retail, 10-49,bcorporation.net/directory/wallaroo-hat-company,2019,81.1,31.7,11.4,5.9,14.5,17.3,2.5,0.0,0.7,0,0.5,4.3,,14.2,4.7,,2.7,,,,,,,,,,3.1,,,,,,,2.4,,,,,,,8.9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.4,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,3.2,,,,,,,,,,,,0.5,,2.7,,3.9,7.2,2.9,,,,,,,,,,1,4654,"Casual, comfortable style with optimal sun protection.

Finding the perfect online therapist in San Francisco can be a daunting experience. We've changed all that. We spend our days putting the needs of others above our own. That's what therapy can help you discover. Outside influences are often blamed for the chaos inside our minds. Yet, there's only one person you wake up next to every day of your life. By focusing on your self, we can support and promote lifelong change across all the relationships in your life. You're in good hands the moment you reach out. We use a human-driven matching process (no algorithms here) to match you with the best therapist for your needs. In most cases, the path from ""you reaching out"" to ""your first online therapy session"" is less than a week. We are 40 compassionate San Francisco therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and mental health professionals. To meet the whole team, visit our staff page. If your new therapist isn't a match, just give us a call and we can try again. We strive to empower our clients to make human connection a priority in their lives, and this starts with a warm and welcoming clinic and clinician – and a nurturing and healthy workplace for our staff.

With the guidance of external consultation, we are committed to addressing the manifestations of white supremicist culture at the clinic as well as providing financial support to anti-racism activists. Our goal is to build structure into the company that will outlive the fervor of this moment and create meaningful change while also using our position in the community to help others do the same. The task force meets regularly to monitor our action steps and to hold each other accountable in the long term. From the beginning, my husband and I felt like we were in a comfortable and safe space. Our couple's therapy bridged gaps in our relationship and helped us understand each other that much more. Well Clinic is an oasis, especially for busy professionals like me. It's a relaxing and safe space, nothing like the stuffy or drab offices you'd expect when going to a therapist. Well Clinic's inviting and professional design makes me feel comfortable and at ease, which probably benefits the work I am doing.

Welcome to Wuxly. Hailing from Toronto, we are the innovators of the first animal-free and sustainable parka brand proudly manufactured in Canada. Incepted in 2012, Wuxly began when pro-football player, James Yurichuk, moved from the west coast to join the Toronto Argonauts. His task? Getting his girlfriend, Brazilian-born Daniela, her very first winter coat. In his search for the perfect parka, James could not find anything that aligned with his values around protecting the environment.

Noticing the quality of Canadian made jackets, James saw an opportunity to evolve Canada’s rich manufacturing heritage by utilizing innovative and sustainable fabrics while peacefully leaving animals out of the equation.

Thus began the Wuxly Movement – a commitment to reshore Canadian manufacturing and create warmth through sustainably made outerwear. Now, we know what you’re thinking: was the parka a success? It's safe to say it kept Daniela very warm in her new climate. She and James still live in Toronto, now with their four beautiful children.","Apparel, Footwear & Accessories",Consumer Products & Services,,Canada,Ontario,Toronto,Wholesale/Retail, 10-49,bcorporation.net/directory/wuxly-movement,2020,88.0,24.1,4.8,15.2,16.0,27.7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.9,3.5,,,5.6,,5.5,,,,,,,,,,9.3,,,,,,,4.8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.3,,,,,,,,,,6.2,,,,,,,4.0,,,,,,,0.1,,0.0,,,1.4,,3.3,,6.4,9.6,7.3,,,,,,,,,,1,4230,"Born in the city, bred for the whole country.

The ways in which we can all enjoy the Park and our lodges may be a bit different for now, but the majesty of Yosemite is unfailing and our warm hospitality is here to provide you with an ideal 'home away from home' while you treat yourself and your loved ones to a refreshing getaway. You'll love everything big and small at both lodges our nightly tradition of fireside s'mores, free planning advice from our friendly team of Recreation experts, heated saltwater pools, therapeutic massage treatments in our open-air cabanas, tasty food and drinks served outside, and stunning Sierra sunsets. The Evergreen is a newly expanded historic resort with 88 cabins spread throughout 20 acres of woods, just one mile from Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy entrance. Rush Creek provides a relaxed yet sophisticated experience inspired by its 20-acre hillside setting at the Highway 120 West entrance to the park. The first brand new lodge in the area in over 25 years, Rush Creek features a tastefully appointed mix of 143 rooms, suites and villas. No vacation hotspot sums up the diversity of the Californian landscape quite like Yosemite National Park, which was named a World Heritage Site in 1984. The unparalleled range of scenery throughout its 1,200 square miles of wilderness attracts visitors throughout the year, while the opportunity for adventurers to enjoy an array of outdoor activities keeps their adrenaline racing every minute of the day. Visitors can find stunning waterfalls and dramatic cliff faces, rolling meadows and ancient giant sequoias, and deep valleys with jagged peaks. Whether you're taking in a spectacular sunset with a loved one or trekking the trails in search of the next jaw-dropping sight, there's plenty to love in Yosemite National Park. Insider Tips on Yosemite National Park Hotels For summer and peak holiday stays, hotels in Yosemite Valley usually fill a year in advance, but there are still plenty of terrific options just outside the park entrances. Hotels near Yosemite National Park specialize in catering to a steady stream of guests arriving to explore the park's wonders in search of lifelong memories, so you can expect nothing but the best from their services. Many visitors prefer to stay beside the park itself, where you find the friendliest service, lots of fun perks like nightly fireside s'mores roasting, nature talks and a variety of fun and games, while still enjoying unbeatable proximity to awe-inspiring scenery and the main attractions. You're also more likely to find some of the best Yosemite hotel deals in a wider range of options, from low-cost, no-frills establishments, to local inns and spas for those hoping to add some luxury to their vacation. Just 30 minutes' drive from Yosemite's Highway 120 West/Big Oak Flat entrance, picturesque Groveland is a scenic historic Old West town that's perfect for travelers hoping to explore several local points of interest—Yosemite National Park and Stanislaus National Forest to the East, and California Gold Country and the High Sierra to the North. If you're in the market for discount hotels near Yosemite National Park, Visit Tuolumne County is a great resource for finding and booking directly with the owners of the place that suits you best. By booking directly with your preferred property, you'll get the best service and the best prices. Groveland is also home to sweeping vistas and great amenities, some at a lower price than found elsewhere in the region. It's also a hub for all sorts of outdoor adventures such as hiking, rock climbing, mountain biking and world-class whitewater rafting. VisitTuolumneCounty.com is also a great way to find a local guide or outfitter who can help you have the adventure of a lifetime. Things to See and Do While the number of incredible sights in Yosemite National Park is endless, the most unforgettable experience is probably to be had while standing beneath the roaring Yosemite Falls, the park's tallest waterfall and one of the largest in the world. While there are several must-see waterfalls in the park—and most make for stunning photo ops—the sheer majesty of Yosemite Falls has to be seen to be believed. Late in the summer Yosemite Falls tends to dry up, but you can still experience Bridalveil Fall year-round, and you can hike to other exceptional waterfalls like Vernal and Nevada Falls along the John Muir Trail. For the best panorama in the area, try Glacier Point. From this viewpoint, you can take in commanding views of Yosemite Valley, El Capitan, Half Dome and the High Sierra, and even try some cross-country skiing in winter. For a little R & R, visit the Ansel Adams Gallery or the Yosemite Museum Gallery to witness the creativity that springs from this inspirational setting. How to get to Yosemite National Park There are four main entrances to Yosemite National Park that allow you to drive in one way and out another. Highway 120 West, Highway 140 West, and Highway 41 South are all open year-round; Highway 120 East closes for the Winter each year, usually between November and May. There is also a fifth entrance at the lesser-traveled Hetch Hetchy region in the northwest section of the park. To get to Yosemite National Park without a car, Amtrak rail provider operates train routes to nearby destinations, and onward minibus transfers to the park are available. Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System operates the YARTS buses that shuttle passengers between the gateway communities and Yosemite Valley. Schedules vary seasonally and are available online at YARTS.com. For travel in Yosemite National Park itself, the free Yosemite Valley shuttle runs to several key locations in and around the area. Even better, hike the trails or try some cross-country skiing to really take in the splendor that's all around you. More than half of Yosemite National Park falls within the boundaries of California's Tuolumne County, so the experts at the Visit Tuolumne County visitors bureau are a great resource for travel tips, planning advice and help connecting with the local businesses that will provide you with your ideal version of a Yosemite experience, and the best rates and service. Yosemite Conservancy raises millions of dollars each year to help maintain the park. One of their many projects includes live webcams at key locations throughout the park."

We believe today's hiring process overlooks the human behind the resume, resulting in a detrimental disconnect between business and leader. We desire a world where everyone finds fulfillment from the work they do and where businesses have the greatest positive impact. Leveraging our proven Y Scouts Leadership Model and covert approach, we're always searching for the WHY. Through our Hiring on Purpose process, we help define our client's success outcomes and connect aligned leaders with meaningful, impactful work. Our expertise finding and connecting exceptional leaders to mission-driven companies has proven successful through the hundreds of long-standing leadership placements we've made over the years. In short, we've created a better way, for a better reason, that achieves better results for our clients and the candidates with whom we matched them. We don't do placements. We align leaders and work. Placement is a cold top-down approach, focusing on resumes and filling empty seats. By hiring on purpose, we take the broken vertical model and flip it on its side, creating horizontal alignment between leader and company. We bridge the gap between the business' purpose and a leader's passions and strengths. It is purposeful and methodical and driven by empathy. It's why we exist. There was a time when it was only about the resume when searching for a leader. Y Scouts has literally redefined executive recruiting to assure we have the right leader driving the bus. I've had the pleasure of being recruited by Y Scouts and subsequently have used Y Scouts twice to source C-Level resources. The Y Scouts engagement with both Clients and Candidates is far beyond anything I've seen in my 20+ years as a hiring manager at a Fortune-500 firm working with internal and external recruiters. Y Scouts works collaboratively to ensure that you understand and can define clearly what you are looking for as a Client, and they work equally hard to identify and present only candidates that are legitimately ready to exceed your expectations. Their unique level of engagement and leadership through this process is refreshing and adds significant value in allowing leaders to better understand 'what and why' they are looking for in their next critical leadership member; and then they find them. The level of engagement was far more than I've ever seen from other executive firms. I can't thank you enough for the work and results from your team provided for us. You took the scary experience of finding someone that I would trust to run our company (which has been my baby for the last ten years) and made it feel structured, safe, and precise. I don't know that it's an over-exaggeration to say that you found us the exact right person for the position and we couldn't be happier. We're not spending hours interviewing multiple candidates. When we get one or two candidates to look at, we already know the purpose, vision and skill set is there. They do the work for us in advance, so we don't need to do it in-house or as we're interviewing. It was so much better than anything else I've ever experienced. You guys are in a different league. The process, the way you communicated, how you're organized, the values alignment. I could not have been happier. If we had to do this all over again, we'd come right back to your doorstep. Your investigative research laid the foundation for an efficient search/interview process. By the time we were introduced to candidates, it was clear that they had been well-vetted and were great potentials. Most contractors (91%) are in their middle to late careers and work in higher seniority roles a year sooner than peers in non-contract roles on average ""Organizations whose leaders are role models for prioritizing health and work/life balance reported higher median satisfaction rates (85%) and employee agreement of organizational support (85%), compared to organizations whose leaders were not role models (75% and 73%, respectively),"" the authors observe. The cannabis market is expected to grow at a remarkable pace and will generate almost $23 billion by 2021, which is a 21% growth rate per year."

We share them in exceptional ways. What Our Clients are Saying Find out more about us There are those who understand the magic of literature, and there are those who understand the wizardry of reaching large numbers of people—but any overlap in these categories is rare enough to be deeply precious. As an author, I was lucky enough to be dropped into the hands of one of these extra-specialists: Zoe Grams. With a tactical understanding of shifting media landscapes and a therapist's patience for fragile creative egos, she raises the craft of public relations into art. Privately, among friends, I have referred to her as ""the bad-ass Queen of publicity."" Well, let me say it publicly: she's it. I have worked with marketing and publicity specialists for many book launches over the years and Zoe Grams is simply as good as it gets. She is brilliant at what she does, a joy to work with, and above all she never mistakes activity for results. We engaged Zoe and her team to help us to highlight a cause as well as to share the stories of individual companies. We were thrilled with the results and the breadth of coverage we received. ZG Stories is professional and effective. They provided an exceptional level of customer service, including additional support in the form of coaching and media training. I'm so grateful that I had the chance to work with Zoe, Ariel, and Rebecca. The ZG Stories team is everything you want when you're trying to get the world to pay attention to your work—professional, kind, prompt, thorough, thoughtful, and, above all, effective. If you're unsure about whether you need their services, let me help: you do. I very much hope I get the chance to work with them again. Working with ZG Stories was an absolute pleasure. Zoe and her team are organized, responsive, and innovative thinkers, with impressive attention to detail and total commitment to their clients. It's been a wonderful experience. I'm so happy with the coverage the novel's received in so many areas and your prompt, professional, and warm approach. As a PR person who owned the biggest agency in Vancouver I am very picky about the PR people who work for me. I would hire Zoe Grams again without hesitation. She is thoughtful, professional and effective. I felt incredibly taken care of during the launch of my first book Make It Happen and couldn't have asked for a better experience. The amount of press I received totally exceeded my expectations, and was a huge reason for my book's success. I loved working with ZG Stories. They always made me feel heard and understood if I had questions and they were incredibly organized with the interviews I booked. They got a tremendous amount of media opportunities for my book, Depression The Comedy and I am eternally grateful to them. I would work with them again in a heartbeat, which means super quick, in case you're not a medical person. Having published with five different publishers and numerous PR teams over the years, I know good PR and marketing when I am fortunate enough to receive it. ZG Stories are among the best. Not only did they keep me informed every step of the way on exactly what they were doing and why, (as well as what the responses were) their campaign resulted in numerous TV and radio appearances and great magazine coverage for my book. When I had questions, they had answers, and during the whole media campaign, I knew I was in capable hands, working with professionals with great networks and contacts. Nobody can guarantee the success of any project, but with ZG Stories, you can be sure you are giving your book every opportunity. For my third book, I was put into the incredibly capable hands of Zoe Grams and Megan Jones at ZG Stories. I'm hard to impress, and I was immediately impressed. The entire promotional campaign was meticulously planned and professionally communicated well in advance. Once publication hit, I have never had a title that has enjoyed so much publicity, particularly from the ever-fickle and increasingly-hard-to-get mainstream media. Once I hit the road for a book tour, I was again blown away by ZG Stories' attention to detail—everything was planned, timed, and looked after—which, when you're out there and wondering, ""if this is Wednesday, is this Saskatoon?"", was very, very appreciated. Working with ZG Stories was a fantastic experience. ZG Stories provided us with invaluable and quality publicity service for David Moscrop's Too Dumb For Democracy campaign. Our author had a busy schedule, and ZG never missed a beat from start to finish, executing a calculated plan and communicated with acuity on all fronts. The results were exceptional. ZG Stories opened our eyes to marketing and outreach opportunities we had never considered. We were extremely impressed with all their efforts publicizing our event and relish the opportunity to work with Ms Grams and her team again. ZG Stories has made an enormous contribution to increasing the profile of the VWF and the marketing of our events in just one year. Their campaigns are original and creative, thoughtfully tailored to the specific audiences we are trying to reach. They are knowledgeable and discerning about when and how to use traditional media or social media and are constantly looking for new, fresh forms of communication. They are passionate about what they do and consistently deliver high quality work in a timely fashion. And maybe most important, they're a heck of a lot of fun to work with. One of our closest and most treasured collaborators. ZG Stories have handled marketing on dozens of our book projects and without fail we're wowed by their results and professionalism. If you're looking for someone with integrity who delivers more than promised, ZG is a great fit. Your help has been excellent: it really helped me to prioritize and know what to do in what order. Thank you for that. Our sincere thanks and a standing O for your great work to promote Lost On Arrival with a robust social media and online campaign. It was a real pleasure working with ZG Stories. We'd do it again in a heartbeat. I have worked with ZG Stories on a number of different editorial projects. They are some of the most professional, personable individuals I have ever had the pleasure of working with. I know I can always count on them to produce high-quality writing that is engaging, well researched and polished – even when adhering to tight deadlines and accommodating last-minute requests. I would highly recommend the ZG Stories team and look forward to continuing our working relationship in the future. ZG Stories made me feel like a rock star. They created a strategy for putting my book out into the world, executed it perfectly and were clearly experts at one of the most challenging aspects of promoting an author – the care and feeding of the author. They sent regular updates to make sure I stayed on top of my schedule and they lined up enough events to ensure I had a schedule. They are a joy to work with and I will definitely have to write more books so we can keep each other busy. I had the distinct pleasure of working with ZG Stories on two projects. Both were somewhat complicated; there were lots of balls in the air in the planning and execution of the contracts, but ZG Communications brought their extraordinary organizational and people skills, as well as genuine enthusiasm for our objectives to create very successful outcomes for us. In addition to the above attributes, Zoe Grams is also an absolute delight to work with and a genuinely lovely person. I cannot recommend ZG Stories too highly. Their team has used their creativity to partner us with organizations like the David Suzuki Foundation, had us speak to thousands of children, and resulted in national exposure on the CBC. Every detail is considered, and the result has been a very fun ride while our books have become national bestsellers. Most importantly, from project to project, we have not tread the same ground twice; each promotion is its own entity. ZG Stories developed a marketing strategy for the launch of our new creative writing summer camp for kids. Their work was excellent. They gave us exactly what we didn't know we needed, and clued us in to how to best approach our audience. They are efficient, professional, reliable, well-connected, and they wield powerful resources. They're savvy and supportive. I felt safe asking questions, and I knew our camp was in the right hands. They understood our story and helped us tell that story to as many people as possible. I loved working with ZG Stories, who so skillfully promoted my latest book After The Sands. Zoe and her team are thorough, creative and true professionals. They have the network and know-how to set up interviews, book tour itineraries, media interviews and publicity. A great pleasure to work with. It's really been a great experience and very fun too. The publicity campaign performed by ZG Stories for The Call of the World: A Political Memoir by Bill Graham was an enormous success. In fact, they exceeded our expectations. Everything was handled professionally, thoughtfully, tenaciously, timely, and strategically, plus it was affordable. Time and time again, Zoe connected all the dots, anticipating every need and capitalizing on each opportunity. For every unforeseen hitch she devised a flawless rescue, without a single misstep. I cannot tell you how impressed I have been with your capacity to so capably and professionally jump into this role and run with things. I feel it has been incredibly successful and I am very grateful to you for absolutely every little thing. I am so grateful I found Zoe at ZG Stories. She took my book and my business to the next level with her leadership, accountability, strong presence in the community and her incredible knowledge of the industry. I felt like I could trust every step of the way completely with her guidance and genuine interest in my project. Communications is more than just sharing ideas and thoughts. It's about initiating meaningful change in our world, encouraging critical thinking, and leaving indelible marks on our communities. This only happens if you have a strategy. Zoe Grams has been successful in creating strategy and leading a team of communication professionals in raising the profile of the KidSafe Project Society. Our children, our families, and some of the most vulnerable British Columbians are the beneficiaries of her work and we are tremendously grateful. I'm very grateful for the level of professionalism you bring—and the media response was fantastic. At every step, Zoe Grams has been a tremendous collaborator and resource for our new publishing venture. She's savvy, insightful, and full of sound advice—and, not least, very well connected. If you're looking for someone to help bring your project into the world and get the right message out, call her. Zoe listens, she is highly creative and she follows through. With Zoe, I never had the impression that they was following a well worn path, and I loved her style of always getting back to me with a review her activities on my behalf. Simply put, if my next book publisher offers me a publicist I will suggest they contract Zoe Grams. If they don't, I will hire her myself—she is that good. Working with ZG Stories has been both a delight and a huge success. These things are both particularly thrilling as a first-time author of a somewhat niche book. Within a week of signing on with ZG, I had profiles secured in major daily newspapers and invitations from two book festivals. Zoe and her team know books and they know the arts; they know who and how to pitch, which is vitally important to everybody involved. Zoe and her team are smart, creative, organized and wonderfully ambitious. Most importantly, though, they care about their clients and the work we're all doing. The arts needs champions like ZG, and I am so lucky to have them in my corner. Zoe Grams and I have worked together on many occasions. She has always been helpful, friendly and professional, making my job as a journalist easier. Zoe has great ideas and creates strong relationships, which means I'm always open to her suggestions. I look forward to collaborating with Zoe on many more projects. Zoe knows the publishing industry inside out. She ably summarized my book and provided all the publicity materials I needed, as well as an effective strategic plan that was my guide for every aspect of the project. Zoe's talent lies in her ability to succinctly and provocatively distil a message then sell it broadly through media relations built on a tradition of trust. Meaningful conversations are the foundation of our work."
